### On Digital…
#### Strategy, Technology, Transformation & a Growing Talent Debt

The ‘Digital Revolution’ has all forms of institutions scrambling to undertake technology advocated programmes to ensure they remain viable and relevant\. And still, there’s great confusion on what “digital” is and what that means for organisations\.

Within this fast\-paced new world of ever evolving and rapidly commoditised technologies, how does any Institution stand apart? How does any organisation capture market share in a market that shifts, ebbs and flows with every evolution? Is the workforce ready? What does a digital transformation affect? Are there gaps left in the business landscape? And what do boards and executives need to know, so they can be better positioned to ask, plan and act for the “next industrial revolution”?

Rapid advances in technology are not only altering how we undertake tasks, but the way we undertake business\.

Institutions have been undergoing abrupt changes over the last decade, from the digitisation\[1\] of assets being converted from individual analogue streams of information into digital bits, to the “digitalisation” of the business through computer\-assisted process characterised by a single communications infrastructure that links all activities across society, and let us not forget the overall “digital transformation” that embodies an enterprise\-wide evolutionary leap that is driven by a Customer\-Centric Value Proposition and often powered by a world where the redefinition of the strategic, cultural, process and operating models is a necessity to ensure a continued future in the new “digital economy”\.

The focus of many technology advocated transformation drives is often to provide business with greater levels of accessibility and granularity in specific arenas\. For example, the availability and granularity of both public and private data which is accessible by organisations has already spawned its own set of technology solutions, business drivers, processes, and even new regulations and governing policies\.

The accompanying advances in deep\-machine\-learning have seen many businesses consider the future as a world where RPA\[2\] and MI\[3\] could replace humans in the continuing drive to provide a greater value proposition to empowered consumers created from the ‘Amazon effect’\. \[4\] Yet in this relentless drive, enterprises may find that there are hidden eddies of various institutional debts — technology, architectural and talent, amongst others — left in its digital wake, quietly accumulating in the background and not referenced on any balance sheet\.

With so much change on the horizon, there are many challenges facing tomorrow’s workforce\. Futurists and analysts warn that these changes may render up to half of the existing workforce replaceable by automation\-based technologies in the next decade\. These issues are not confined to large enterprises, they affect all forms of institutions — listed, private, public and NFP — and each will need to take these risks into consideration as part of their digital journey\.

The purpose of digital may be argued by many who have a vested interest, however success is ultimately tallied as the ability to provide _value to the customer_ — seamlessly, instantly, ubiquitously\. Put simply, a digital organisation is one that centres upon and improves the _human experience_ behind _every_ interaction\.

As Futurist Ross Dawson\[5\] states — “knowledge and skills without intrinsically human capabilities are of limited value\. People who have only knowledge will not be useful in a dynamic work environment\.”

While collectively there is a need to ensure that societal awareness drives changes in educating the next generation to “focus on developing underlying human capabilities, not just knowledge and skills”, the reality is that these rapid shifts are forcing institutions to focus on the intrinsic and unique human capabilities — those that distinguish us from machines — and must meet the responsibility of meeting \(and reducing\) these challenges to maintain a competitive stake, let alone gain an advantage\.

According to Dawson, it’s crucial that our education systems focus not only on the skills that will be most relevant to future workplaces — Technology, Analysis, Business and Design — but also uniquely human capabilities such as creativity, the ability to learn, be adaptable and collaborate\.

This view is not only shared, but practiced, by Heather McGowan\[6\] who advises and guides corporate executives to re\-think and re\-frame their business models, and their understanding of team and organisational structures, to be resilient and successful in changing markets\. Heather also imparts the message that schools and institutions need to develop learning agility as well as critical thinking skills in order to prepare people for jobs that do not yet exist\.
### Digital vs Digital?
#### Technology is not a proxy for business practices\.

Allow me to echo a mantra: ‘Digital’ is not ‘about technology’\.

The purpose of digital is to provide a valuable experience to the customer — seamlessly, instantly and ubiquitously\.

It is not the technology — it is not the platform, nor the service — it is the _solution_ that is created to _meet the alignment_ of the purpose, strategy, and most importantly of all — the customer centred need\.

Yet time and again, we see the same erroneous technology\-driven wholesale changes made to an organisation — and you don’t have to look far to find statistics on the sorry state of these so\-called digital transformations\.

Forbes says, ”84% of Companies Fail at Digital Transformation”\. \[7\] A Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey\[8\] points out that only 41% of companies have an enterprise wide digital strategy, and only 18% of companies rate their use of digital technology as “very effective” and the MIT Centre for Information Systems Research \(CISR\) has found that only 28% of established companies\[9\] have successfully digitised\[10\] at all\.

In light of these damning numbers, why would any institution consider undertaking a digital transformation?

Fundamentally, because there is no real choice to ‘opt out’\[11\] \.

Let me be clear — you don’t need a digital strategy\. What you need is a better strategy — one enabled by digital\.

> \- Brian Solis — The 2017 State of Digital Transformation, Altimeter 





Where many institutions go wrong are by taking old, broken processes that were born out of necessity and simply converting them into a digitised form\. While such pursuits are often internally heralded as shining examples of innovation and digital transformation, what they are usually amounts to little more than expensive, and at best incremental, improvements\.

Today’s institutions are all being affected by a customer base that wants a quick and seamless digital experience, and they want it now\. Thanks to the experiences that companies such as Amazon and Apple provide, they now expect every institution to deliver products and services swiftly with a seamless user experience\.

Customer expectations drive fundamental business model changes\. They are demanding a radical overhaul of business processes to ensure a seamless experience whether they are dealing in a B2B or B2C relationship\.

Consider the most common learning and insights from a survey of more than 500 executives and digital strategists undertaken to understand the challenges and opportunities they faced as they underwent their digital transformations\. Altimeter reported these in “The 2017 State of Digital Transformation”\[12\] which included:

• As all companies increasingly become “technology companies,” the roles of the IT department is more important than ever — with the Chief Information Officer \(CIO\) most often at the helm \(28%\) of the digital transformation effort\. However, true success in digital transformation is an enterprise\-wide, cross\-functional endeavour\.

• “Evolving customer behaviours and preferences” was often cited as the top driver of digital transformation, yet fewer than half invested in understanding digital customers and only 34\.8% of businesses having fully mapped the customer journey\.

• The pursuit of digital transformation carries challenges with the employee experience a crucial, yet often overlooked element of a successful digital transformation\. There are still many ensuring viability in a digital economy, with respondents identifying:
- a lack of digital talent and expertise \(31\.4%\);
- only about half are investing in new digital talent;
- attempts to modernise workforce skillsets with new training programs \(62%\);
- general culture issues \(31%\)


• Many businesses still hold a perception that digital transformation is a cost with only 37% of businesses viewing digital transformation as an investment in the fight against market disruption\.

Digitisation brings with it new roles — such as audience strategists, data scientists, user\-experience designers or digital knowledge managers — however, it just as often requires that old wisdom be combined with new skills — such as training product managers to program pricing algorithms or up\-skilling market analysts to utilise digital tools in new areas such as social listening\.

The institutional strategy, the operating models, organisational structures, the skills, competency and capability mapping — as well as the roles that align to them — all need to be redesigned to match the reinvented processes\. As previously mentioned, the need for a better strategy, enabled by digital drives the creation of a **Digital Business Model** \(DBM\) which maps the path forward\.

Many institutions baulk at the overwhelming rate and scope of change such a holistic view a DBM provides, and that is where a \(micro\)services view of _technology enabled business function architecture_ is just one way to break up the DBM into tactical, constrained and manageable programmes\.

One consideration is to utilise the following three interlocking paths to target transformation projects:

• Atomisation — the process of breaking down a process, job or function into functional components\. This is often currently seen in the ‘gig economy’ via the likes of Uber, AirTasker or fiver\.

• Automation — where functional components \(and increasingly, entire processes or functions\) can be done entirely by non\-biologic intelligence\. This can be seen in software\-based RPA,2 analytical data\-driven suggestion and scheduling engines\.

and

• Augmentation — where using technology and artificial intelligence to extend the human potential — like the robots used in surgery, or AI augmented batch cancer testing\. \[13\]

These programmes are not taken in isolation\.

Rethinking every step is critical to the digital mindset — reinvent the entire business process\. Consider the minimum viable process to deliver the value stream\. Don’t seek to cut the number of steps in existing processes, instead, start with adding only those that that provide real value and speed up the _overall outcome_ \.

Only after the base value stream is defined should you remap and include the essential regulatory, policy and governance controls and consider the options for automated process flow or decision making\. Data models will need to be created, adjusted or completely rebuilt to enable better decision making, performance tracking, market and customer insights\. Review, trim and repeat as required\.

All of that is still only just the beginning\.

It’s more than a superior user experience supported by technological changes\. While intuitive interfaces, around\-the\-clock availability, real\-time fulfilment, personalised treatment, global consistency, and zero errors are all aspects that customers are increasingly demanding \(and accustomed to receiving\), these are not ‘bolt\-on’ functions or aesthetic styling, but a fundamental alteration to the organisational structure and delivery capability\.

Meeting these higher expectations requires institutions to accelerate the digitisation of their business\. That’s an exercise that is more than simply automating existing processes\. It requires the reinvention of the entire business process — often this includes returning to the mission \(purpose\) and drawing the shortest number of steps to the end customer value proposition\.

When institutions get it right, the advantages can translate to reduced operational costs, more competitive prices, better operational controls, appropriately managed risks and the agility to take advantage of strategic opportunities\.

Which leads us to the engine of any successful transformation …
### Culture is Strategy
#### “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”, \(and moves onto other initiatives for lunch\. \)

Ever since Peter Drucker\[14\] made that remark it’s been ‘common sense’ and a truth known in any discussion on organisational change\.

A healthy culture and a sound business strategy are not separated\. Just as with any organisational transformation, if an institution does not have a strong culture, it won’t be able to effectively execute any strategy in a sustainable way\. At the same time, if an institution doesn’t have the focus and direction of a strategy, the \(desired\) culture won’t survive\. When it comes down to it, _people always make the difference_ \.


> Culture is what happens when the boss leaves the room\. 





> \- Anonymous 




In an age where we continue to hear established multinationals continuing to cite shareholder value, which has been described as “the dumbest idea in the world”,\[15\] institutions need to return to defining a better strategy which is enabled by digital, because frankly, a digital strategy is not only a misnomer, but implies that the current model can be successfully furthered with a technology enhancement\.

Digital requires an understanding of several threads of wisdom, including an age\-old message that “the purpose of business is to create and keep a customer”\[16\] and the renewed message that ”people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it”\[17\] which is a key foundation stone of the digital enabled strategy\.

However, every building needs load bearing walls, and in the new disrupted business it is embodied by your company’s greatest assets, and your true competitive advantage, your employees\. \[18\] Your institutional journey demands an understanding that culture is strategy and is embodied through key messages such as ”if you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients”\[19\] and in the principles of many of the digital era methods such as ”individuals and interactions over processes and tools\.”\[20\]

The point being that this is not a new concept — and definitely not unique to the ‘digital transformation’ journey\.

The beginning of a digitally enabled strategy is thus understanding that the strategy is just the headline of the institution’s story\.

Swift, wholesale culture change is not possible — or even desirable\. After all, a company’s culture is its basic personality, the essence of how its people interact and work\. Corporate culture means different things to different people\. It is emotional, ever\-changing, and complex\. Culture is vulnerable, and as moody as the people who define it\. Most of all, _culture is human_ \.

When we simplify the concept, culture is fundamentally the self\-sustaining pattern of behaviour that determines how things are done\. The institution needs to care and groom the culture ‘entity’ to help define these patterns of behaviour\.

Like a cat, it needs gentle guidance and positive reinforcement\. It needs a clearly understood common language to embrace, to own and \(re\)tell the story that incorporates the mission, vision, values, and, most of all, the clear expectations of the outcome\.

It is not a one\-off exercise\. Culture is built \(or eroded\) every day\. institutional culture is otherwise ‘eating what it kills’ — whether that is strategy, change management, innovation, operational efficiency, lean process or even the vision and mission of the institution\.

When an institution shapes its purpose around its values, it is really defining the culture for the institution\. The institution’s core values — and its purpose — are the fundamental building blocks of the culture\. While the mission defines why the institution exists to do what it does, and the vision states where it aspires to be — the values define how the institution wants to achieve their goals\.


> A hallmark of a healthy creative culture is that its people feel free to share ideas, opinions, and criticisms\. Lack of candour, if unchecked, ultimately leads to dysfunctional environments\. 





> — Ed Catmull, President, Pixar 




That’s why it’s so important to align the institutional metrics with the management actions to the values — management needs to live and demonstrate the institution’s purpose on a daily basis\.

Digital business has a different culture and mindset than traditional business and Digital Leaders are required to manage the culture and mindset which will incorporate helping set the pace of business, enable distributed decision\-making and set flexible, distributed workplaces — all of which are seen as the biggest differences between digital and traditional businesses\.

Digital institutions push decision\-making further down into the structure\. If an institution wishes to become more innovative, more entrepreneurial, faster moving, more collaborative and empowered, then an autonomous, authorised and distributed decision\-making structure is needed to change the way the institution operates\.

The key traits of effective Digital Leadership within these institutions are all about enabling the digital operational model — providing vision and purpose, creating conditions to experiment, empowering people to think differently, and getting people to collaborate across boundaries\.

Digital leaders understand that there is a fundamental difference between saying “we need an intelligent sensor connected app” and “we need a new way to effectively serve customers — in a way, time and place they want”\.

Developing — not just hiring — digital leaders sets digitally maturing companies apart\. According to a joint MIT Sloan and Deloitte Research Report,\[21\] ‘digitally mature’ institutions are four times more likely to be developing needed digital leaders than the least digitally mature ones\.
### Employee 2\.0
#### Development of human talent is still required for successful and sustainable institutions\.

We are entering the era that will be reigned by humankind 2\.0 — a more intelligent, more self\-aware, more connected, and integrated version of our species that will push the frontiers of our collective knowledge and answer what was long held to be the unknown\.

When it comes to the “4th industrial revolution”, we will be seeing a continuing merger of Technologies \(e\.g\. SMACCIT\) \[22\] with human augmentation and physical systems\. Everything around us has, or will gain, some form of intelligence\. With this change, there is an increasing trend of anything mentally attained or predictable can be achieved \(or replaced\) by an algorithm\. This drive no longer just creates a replacement of physical labour by non\-biological intelligence but infringes upon what was the hallmark of previous labour justification — cognitive labour\.

The Machine Intelligence \(colloquially referred to as AI\) \[23\] fields of today are often perceived as a replacement technology, yet far more often, the evidence of greater results in symbiotic utilisation are evident\.

As such, institutions should already be thinking about technology as an enhancement to their workforce, not as a replacement\.


> Culture is about making employees feel supported and empowered to do the best work of their lives 





> \- Annette Ferrara, IDEO 




As traditional training and development paths are replaced with cheaper labour sources, robotic process automation and deep learning algorithms — are institutions able to source the requisite knowledge workers in the regional markets or must they prepare to develop and manage the new capability sets required for the workforce of tomorrow?

One area to explore is the field of Intelligence Amplification \(IA\) \. \[24\] IA describes the goal of a human\-machine symbiosis that is focussed on the propelling capabilities that technologies, such as machine learning and automation, could bring to provide human\-enhancing augmentation\.

Douglas Engelbart theorised\[25\] that humans could co\-exist with sophisticated methods, and high\-powered electronic aids to ensure “more\-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insolvable\. And by complex situations we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers — whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years\.”

Technologists have learned that it is often much easier to build specific MI capabilities \(such as language translation or facial recognition\) by using large, specialised data sets than it is to develop general\-purpose learning capabilities\. Each MI capability has its own niche — with specific use cases, applications, business models and increasingly, focused start\-up in that space\. Simultaneously, great strides are also being made toward a more traditional goal of general\-purpose intelligence through Machine and Deep Learning \(ML/\[26\]DL\) \. \[27\]

> – Alvin Toffler 




Yet, even as both streams of MI and DL are taking extensive advantage of cloud economics — with the advantageous of global scale, real\-time Big Data acquisition, an effectively zero marginal cost and continuous improvement capabilities — a form of Artificial General Intelligence \(AGI\) \[28\] is perceivably still many decades away\.

Because of the fact that cognitive labour is now being affected by this “4th Industrial Revolution”, we have to move towards learning agility as well as becoming more adaptable and empathetic, to ensure that we stay relevant in the workplace\.

Yet this is still, simply, a short\-term response\.

As we progress forward over the next few decades, we will find a workplace that is likely unrecognisable to us today\. Yet, the changes that will most affect the workforce of the future is not going to be automation, robotics or AI\. These technology advances will likely deskill swathes of roles, and with that comes the declining value of that labour — as we have already evidenced, for example, when technology, via data accessibility and publishing platforms, impacted the journalism industry — it will pale in comparison to the impact that grand and widespread social disruption created through future technological advancements will impart\.

While intelligent automation will undoubtedly affect many roles, it will pale in comparison to the impact that grand and widespread social disruption created through future technological advancements\.

Consider when automated vehicles \(AV\) become the norm\. Widespread changes to society will follow — and while it’s easy to consider that this will bring changes to infrastructure, public and private transportation services, and of course insurance — how many consider the impact to police \(speed camera revenues\), local government \(parking and infringement notices\) and regulatory departments \(driving license and vehicle registration systems\)? In fact, if you consider that an AV could take any shape — including as a mobile office or as a sleeper — how does that affect hotels or office space?

With such widespread disruption, the very nature of what society will require, and thus the firms and roles required to service this future scenario as part of those changes, are such that we are unable to even consider or name them yet\.

One thing that is certain, however, is that any concept of any future role being unaided by some form of technological augmentation should be discarded\.

If you believe the predictions of Ray Kurzweil, for example, then these disruptive technologies will even disrupt what it means to be human\. The following is extracted from the transcript of his TED2014 Talk titled “Get ready for Hybrid Thinking”:\[29\]

“In the 2030s, if you need some extra neocortex, you’ll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain\. \[…\] And our thinking, then, will be a hybrid of biological and non\-biological thinking, but the non\-biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns\. It will grow exponentially\. And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex? That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads\. Other primates have a slanted brow\. They don’t have the frontal cortex\. But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different\. It’s a quantitative expansion of neocortex, but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take a qualitative leap and invent language and art and science and technology and TED conferences\. No other species has done that\. And so, over the next few decades, we’re going to do it again\. We’re going to again expand our neocortex, only this time we won’t be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure\. It’ll be expanded without limit\. That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology\.”

Which segues back into the need for minding the talent, and the unspoken gap\. How will we develop those capabilities that will serve both humanity and the workforce of the next handful of decades? Where will the responsibility lie? Institutions, through need alone, will face the immediate challenge and need to consider how they will address the capability and mindset gaps this creates\. Yet, if it continues to remain unmet or delayed by organisations, the responsibility will quickly be pushed over and become an even larger education gap\.

This still returns us to the issues of talent, and where it sits in the transformed digital future\.
### Won’t someone think of the talent?
#### The hidden talent debt that institutions are accruing …

The need for continuing development has not escaped individuals, whom in several surveys over the last few years have reported needing to continually develop their skills\. In the latest survey from MIT Sloan Management Review and Deloitte Insights\[30\] 90% of respondents indicated that they felt they needed to update their skills at least yearly and half stating a need to update skills continuously\. Yet the same respondents stated they get little to no support from their institution to do so, with only 34% of respondents satisfied with the degree to which their institution supports ongoing development\.

Employees are willing to do it themselves, given the right support\. Many are seeking institutions to provide and cultivate an on\-the\-job learning environment — ideally one which allows them to experiment and iterate\.


> By focusing on serving people rather than replacing them, we can help them achieve their greatest potential\. 





> \- Justin Massa, IDEO 




As it turns out, those companies that have restructured around the Agile Principles\[31\] have found that this a key to their success\. When you put cross\-functional employees into a dedicated team, they’re baked into those teams, so they understand — and are evaluated against — the same outcomes and results the team’s striving for\. They understand the mission and the urgency which allows them to make decisions differently\. The teams can create sprints around hypothesis where they can experiment, test and learn quickly, through both success and failure, to provide new ways of delivering new product and service opportunities which are of value to customers\.

At the end of the day, so much is about talent\. Talent must also be considered two\-pronged — by capability / skill set and by attitude\. Digital transformation isn’t just a top\-down mandate for everyone “to change”\. It needs the conditions under which existing employees start thinking and working differently and driving change from the bottom up as well\. The aforementioned learning environment creates the very basis of this requirement by promoting a growth mindset culture\.

A growth mindset is key to digital transformation, and it is simply the fundamental belief that a human being’s potential is unknowable and thus talent \(be it intelligence, skill, capability and even personality traits\) can be developed and improved\. That’s what you need to drive an institution forward — and attitude is the one thing institutions sometimes relay to the background as an “intangible” element\.


> An organisation’s ability to learn, and translate that learning into action rapidly, is the ultimate competitive advantage 





> — Jack Welch, President, GE 




Talent development and management is therefore a key element of a successful digital transformation process\. Yet institutions now find themselves with a new dilemma within this sector\. Attention must be placed on retaining and developing knowledge management — incorporating the corporate ethos, memory, and intellectual property — along with those skills that are driven by emerging technologies and the new ‘digital capabilities’\.

Development in the world of the future is going to be more nuanced\. It’ll be a world where vertical progression — which is essentially advocated by the use of focussed high\-performance \(HiPo\) based processes — is no longer feasible\. Where horizontal experiences and networked organisations will become the norm\. How are institutions preparing to ensure a “no excuses” and “be more accountable” attitude aligns with an “everyone deserves continuous development” perspective?

With 5% of all current roles affirmatively destined for the history books, and with some analysts and futurists predicting up to 50% of the workforce likely to be replaced by some form of automation over the next decade, institutions are working under the false pretence that many of the traditional, workforce heavy and oft task repetitive roles will be replaced with cheaper, faster, and eventually superhuman machine learning automation\.

Yet, those traditional learning and development pathways that took entry level vocations through towards experienced competency careers, the very training grounds for the “fast think” space needed in their later careers, are now the very same roles being expelled to low cost centre placements, targeted for replacement in robotic process automation, or obsolescence via machine learning algorithms — all in the name of reducing costs or improved efficiencies\.

So, for the next generation of workforce, where will the impetus for the training and development of vocational discipline that becomes the “muscle memory” or “fast thinking” of an experienced workforce lie?

Do universities need to alter their course structures to implement intense, vocationally\-focussed, experiential based units? Should industry\-based organisations develop a post\-tertiary continued learning & professional development program that specifically focusses on developing graduates for a new set of entry roles? Will new vertically integrated programmes be created to provide specifically customised learning that is designed between an academic establishment and the needs of the institutions they cater for?

Perhaps the answer is that hiring institutions must undertake a philosophy that assumes that a lifelong learning process commences with graduate recruitment and continues on with a HR driven, continuous development and coaching culture where professional growth and progression planning is an essential element — not only for key roles, but for every employee relationship?

The reality remains that many institutions rush towards implementing elements of digital transformation with little thought for how they alter, or in fact eliminate, those traditional funnel roles that feed the vaunted experienced knowledge workers they still value higher in the organisation structure\.

Institutions must remain aware of the skills and experience gaps that are being created in the wake of their transformations and how that talent debt will impact them in their future\.

When it comes to digital transformation, the need for a truly Enterprise level approach is necessary for holistic success\. Synchronised change management is required to ensure that every element of the organisation is not only aware of the initiatives undertaken, but are actively participating to match processes, tools and people that are in\-step with those transformative actions\.

The digital transformation also brings with it a shift for institutions to move from scalable efficiency as a competitive advantage to scalable learning as a competitive imperative\.

John Hagel\[32\] reminds us that it is not possible to achieve scalable efficiency and scalable learning simultaneously\. These rationales are fundamentally conflicted\. On one end, scalable efficiency equates to predictability and reliability, implying there is no room for failure\. However, by definition, learning involves failure\. If we are not failing, we are not learning\.


> Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? 





> – TS Elliot 




Digital business moves more quickly, requires new levels of collaboration across various boundaries, and involves considerable ambiguity and constant change\. Institutions must reorient to not develop stocks of knowledge, but rather work with flows of knowledge\. \[33\] All institutions will need to harness the potential of scalable learning to accelerate performance improvement\. The most valuable learning will not be in the training room but in the workplace\. It will not be about sharing existing knowledge — instead, the focus will be on creating new knowledge — both faster and together\.

Heather McGowan\[34\] recommends that being trained for expertise and knowledge are no longer enough\. In fact, as we move towards a joint Human:IT collaborative labour force, individuals need to move towards upgrading their “Operating system” with increased critical thinking, learning agility — the ability to learn, adapt, and apply in quick cycles — as well as becoming more adaptable and empathetic\.

Figuring out how to reshape the institution in order to take into consideration these scalable learning imperatives and talent development progression becomes an operational imperative in a competitive environment increasingly defined by digital technologies and capabilities\. Whilst ignoring these aspects may still create a seemingly successful transformation in the short term, they are essential for extending the institution’s legacy into the coming years\.
### But, the Technology\!?

It is low\-lying fruit and practically obfuscating to discuss the evolutionary and disruptive technologies that will dominate the news cycles over the next year, yet it will also be remiss of me to simply dismiss the topic\.

As with all advancements, the cycle of technologies will move from genesis\[35\] to custom built\[36\], to product\[37\] and onto commodity\[38\] \. So too are we seeing that the continuing hype of _Internet of Things_ , _intelligent sensors_ , _blockchain_ and _automation_ are rapidly progressing down these cycles and will become commodity technologies in the near future\.

Already, this evolution can be seen in the race to provision _intelligent automation_ — RPA2 is barely implemented in organisations before it is already targeted for augmentation with ML26 algorithms, only to eventually become a commoditised functional MI3 element of the institution\. The shift from a singular technology focus to _programmatic functions **\[39\]**_ will then mature into objective _\-encompassing solutions\._

The drive to automation should be seen as a means to redeploy humans to where they can add the most value to the institution to maximise the impact of both human and machine intelligence\. The use of Machine intelligence and automation should be provisioned exclusively for transactions, all task iteration, data predictability and algorithmic evolution\. Humans will still be the clear winners in leading, improvising, creating and judgement calls\. Everything else in\-between will benefit from an augmentation\-model where human\-machine relationships will maximise the outcomes\.

Blockchain will continue to provide value in the areas of crypto currencies in the short term, as will its use in asset management, however, Blockchain will play a bigger role in the establishment of digital trust for lineage\[40\] based management, especially as a tool for greater transparency and for regulatory assurance\.

The rush towards the supply of _digital products and services_ by the legacy outsource and professional services firms are already forming _digital factories_ — with the first entrants offering the ability for any client to purchase the factory’s industrial power on a commodity basis — that will not only further the pace of technology\-based commoditisation but could fundamentally alter the way institutions undertake wholesale programmes in the future\.

Separately, there is also a similar charge with the _digitally enabled factory_ revolution which has already disrupted the manufacturing industries\. While 3D printing has been making its way out of the garages or SOHO start\-up spaces, and into industrial sheds\[41\] and onto housing developments\[42\], it is only part of the story\. The ability to utilise the findings of analytics allows players to create deeper personalisation of physical products\. Where feasible, the integration of smart sensors, IoT and cloud\-based analytics can not only offer users greater functionality, but also offers the manufacturer in\-situ real data on the use of the product\.

Technologies from both the _virtual reality \(VR\)_ and _augmented reality \(AR\)_ worlds will likely merge to create a new functional _extended reality_ \(XR\) framework which will embrace and merge with other technologies to become a new base for higher level offshoots as industrialised forms of _extended reality_ become platforms from which new activities will be encouraged to be built upon — genesis begets evolution begets genesis\.

While AR is already being utilised for immersive training by the Armed Forces, Chemical Suppliers, Mining Institutions and for HSE Emergency Response scenarios, the propagation into the common experience is likely to see the these platforms becoming evident in the next twelve months through commerce institutions, which will increasingly utilise XR to provide additional commerce\-based services, with the clothing retail sector the most common target in recent start\-up conferences for both in\-store immersive commerce and e\-store direct sales\.

These examples are only to touch upon and highlight that the variations on the technological theme are numerous, however, any technology should be reviewed and experimented with to look beyond the ‘nuts and bolts’ and determine the business use case via the customer value and the outcomes\.

For example, if your institution offered stock data and analysis, what would a two\-second leap on your competitors be worth? Would the cost of purchasing land, laying fibre\-optic cabling and implementing POD\-based computing analytic engines between NYC and Chicago be worth the investment? What if the ROI was returned within the month? What if the competitive advantage only lasted a quarter? Would it be better to be seen as the leader or the follower?

Not all business use cases are valid — when it comes to your institution, what problem does it solve? What customer value does it provide? How does it improve the business proposition? It is not the Technology — neither the platform, nor the service — but the _solution_ to the _outcome_ to meet the alignment of purpose, strategy, and _customer\-centred need_ that is the most important element in the evaluation of any technology\-based discussion for your institution\. If it fails to better the customer value proposition then it must meet the need to provision a competitive advantage or meet the regulatory requirements, otherwise what is its purpose?
### **What to do?**
#### Make a start — it’s complex, but not complicated\.

The purpose of digital is to provide a valuable experience to the customer — seamlessly, instantly and ubiquitously\. Digital is not the Technologies — neither the platforms, nor the services — it is the _Solutions_ that are created to meet the _outcome_ — an alignment of the _purpose_ , _strategy_ , and _customer\-centred need_ \.

For institutions to continue to offer real value through and beyond any digital metamorphosis it must also _retain_ and _re\-assert_ its origin story\. That old wisdom that held the drive behind the _purpose_ and mission needs to be enhanced with a renewed strategy that takes into consideration _new capabilities_ and _new landscapes_ \.

> \- Bob Every, Chairman Boral and Wesfarmers 




As an entity, the Institution needs to formulate a _better business strategy_ \. This is not a “digital strategy” that supports the existing core functionality, but a new strategy that is enabled by the technology of the digital reality\. The drive to ‘digital’ is reminding Institutions to, once again, return to the core purpose and mission and provide a valuable experience to the customer — seamlessly, instantly and ubiquitously\.

The Customer experience \(CX\) will mirror the Employee experience \(EX\) and requires that institutions consider what type of _ethical business_ their customers wish them to be as well as the _digital trust_ requirements to be enforced via implied expectations, not just regulations\. Customers will want to witness these commitments at all levels of the institution, requiring that employees be ambassadors of the brand, with greater levels of proactivity\[43\], Executive\-level commitment\[44\], and most of all, transparency across the entire institution\.

Within this fast\-paced new world of ever evolving and rapidly commoditised technologies, how does any Institution stand apart? How does any organisation capture market share in a market that shifts, ebbs and flows with every evolution?

Institutions need to become _intelligent enterprises_ , harnessing the collaborative strength of human and technological capability\. A shift to envisioning the organisation as a digital ecosystem, where every element of the Institution is a part of the community of interacting components, is essential\. However, extended sustainable institutional survival comes from the developed value from the realisation that the whole, or simply part, of the Institution may be part of a larger, distributed ecosystem\.


> What you need is a better strategy — one enabled by digital\. 




To thrive in this ‘digitised’ universe, all businesses will need to reinvent themselves, substantially changing their organisations to form or enhance their relationship with their customers\. This requires, nay depends on, creating new \(digital\) ways for customers to interact with, and experience, the institution\.

A common example is given to those institutions which have already undertaken the journey and become ‘platform’ businesses\. Amazon and Alibaba are obvious examples, however, AirBnB and TripAdvisor are also both platform\-enabled businesses\. Whilst the focus offered is often on the leveraging of technologies to create and deliver a common experience, it is the fact that the institution can become a hub, providing unique digital propositions to customers by bringing a network of enterprises and people to work together towards a common outcome\. The institution has become an indispensable enabler of value exchange within its _Digital Ecosystem_ \.

Digital Disruption is unrelenting and oft caused by the rapid influx of new technologies applied by new entrants who no longer have a barrier to entry\. They are often smaller, agile entities that offer new customer experiences and access, are chipping away at ‘traditional’ markets in all sectors\.

Digital Transformation is also not about technology; it is about change\. It is about the provide value to customers\. It reiterates a new adage that you don’t need a digital strategy, _you need a Business strategy, enabled by digital_ \.

The institution needs to re\-evaluate, re\-consider and re\-invent every part of their identity and structure — this includes their business operating models, structures, critical competencies, culture and, of course, people\.

Existing competitors who have successfully transitioned to the new ‘digital economy’, have often adopted a new business model or by crossing \(traditional / legacy\) industry boundaries\.


> Don’t measure your performance by what you have accomplished, but by what you should have accomplished within your capabilities\. 





> \- Jeroen De Flander 




The process of understanding the need to undertake a digital transformation should lead to the creation of a Digital Business Model \(DBM\) for the institution\.

To implement a DBM effectively, there must exist certain key elements\. At a minimum, the Institution needs:
1. A _clear business vision_ and strategy\.
2. An understanding of the _experience model_ for all content\[45\] delivery\.
3. _Value Stream **\[46\]**_ clarity from purpose to customer\.


enabled through the:
1. \(Re\)Design of organisation processes focussed on the _Value Stream50_ over the Value Chain\[47\] \.
2. Implementation and use of Intelligent Data Analysis\[48\]
3. Experience based design for _all_ channel interactions\.


In the midst of all of this, the need to recall that while there is a popular narrative that robots and technology are a negative influence that will affect and cull all forms of employment, it fails to account for the compatibility and complimentary nature of a Human:IT interaction\-based transformation\.

Institutions also need to temper the hype and consider what a sustainable, and holistic strategy looks like\. Whilst incorporating a technology enablement, the institution must consider that the expectation of technology needing to fit in with the cultural and socio\-political environment also applies\.

This responsibility incorporates an understanding that while the futurists and industry analysts wax lyrical about the wholesale displacement of roles, the latest empirical studies have estimated that only 5% of all roles will actually be \(completely\) displaced, whilst two\-thirds of all employment will actually be enhanced by the introduction of these technologies\.

The rise of a CoBot\[49\] culture in the short term will morph into a seamless Technology\-Augmented workforce in the near future, which will embody the adage that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\.

As the shift occurs from traditional skills\-based employment, towards an increasingly larger capability\-based workforce, the larger the education and talent gap becomes\. If we agree with Anne Mulcahy19 and concede that employees truly are not only an Institution’s greatest asset but the source of its competitive advantage, then Institutions need to embody the understanding that all work starts and ends with humans\. Institutions need to thus think not only of current needs, but future needs, skills and capabilities that will be required to maintain a competitive edge\.

Part of that analysis requires a consideration of what learning, and adaptation is required, and take the opportunity which exists to re\-skill people who already have industry experience, corporate memory and the internal networks … however the biggest challenge facing many Institutions is the distribution of geography and the division of labour created over the last twenty years in the search for efficiency and low\-cost centres\.
### A Final Thought

There is one truth that still has not been stated — this is all window dressing\.

Understandably, the confusion that a ‘digital transformation’ is ‘all about Technology’ exists due to the drive to remain competitive against an industry that is rapidly undertaking ‘Digitisation’1\. Along with new entrants to the market, competitors are seen to be creating new operational efficiencies and enabling new capabilities or operating models seemingly by ‘just’ implementing the latest technologies\. However, this is akin to attributing the success of the mechanic’s business on the fit\-out of the workshop with the latest tools\.


> The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer\. 





> \- Peter F\. Drucker \(1909–2005\) 




The need to re\-think what is possible is needed from the beginning of any transformation\. Do not seek to replicate the existing processes but utilise new ways of thinking about delivering value to customers\.

From various sources, these messages — maintaining a purpose, building stronger strategy, looking after the customer and being champions and guardians of the effect of its social and economic impact — are repeated in the digital push\. We have heard these messages before, from thought leaders such as Peter Drucker in the 1950s and 1960s through to Simon Sinek in the early 2000s\. We have seen them iterated in the principles and methodologies of Kaizen, Design Thinking and through to the latest iteration of Agile\. The messages, while worded in various ways, are all the same:
- There is only one customer — there are no “internal customers”\. B2B is a misnomer\.
- Firms that focus on the end customer are more successful\.
- Value can only be evaluated by the end customer\.
- “Better products” are determined by the customer\.
- The only scale that matters is the de\-scaling of complexity\.
- Servitude leadership is more successful\.
- Talent drives strategy, not the other way around\.


Yes, technology advances have changed the landscape — significantly — creating lowered barriers to market entry, niche solutions and the ability to undertake tasks and functions with ever increasing speed and ubiquity\. However, these are the symptoms of those changes, not the cause\. For any institution to remain a sustainable and ongoing concern, it must be more than a collection of technological advancements\.

‘Digital’ is reminding Institutions to, once again, return to their core purpose, their mission, and provide a _valuable experience_ to the customer — seamlessly, instantly and ubiquitously — not through a “digital strategy” but through a better strategy, enabled by the full gamut of digital capabilities, equally human and technological\.

Now, pathologists look at hundreds of slides and millions of cells every day\. So, to support this task, some researchers made an AI classifier\. Now, the classifier says, “Is this cancer or is this not cancer?” looking at the pictures\. The classifier was pretty good, but not as good as the person, who got it right most of the time\. But when they combine the ability of the machine and the human together, accuracy went to 99\.5 percent\. Adding that AI to a partnership eliminated 85 percent of the errors that the human pathologist would have made working alone\. That’s a lot of cancer that would have otherwise gone untreated\. Now, for the curious, it turns out that the human was better at rejecting false positives, and the machine was better at recognising those hard\-to\-spot cases\. But the lesson here isn’t about which agent is better at this image\-classification task\. Those things are changing every day\. The lesson here is that by combining the abilities of the human and machine, it created a partnership that had superhuman performance\.”

\[35\] Upon creation, the technology is unique and very rare\. It is experimental and explorative by nature\.

\[36\] The technology evolves from genesis and is now individually made and tailored for a specific environment\. It is bespoke\. It frequently changes\. It is an artisan skill\. You wouldn’t expect to see two implementations that are the same\.

\[37\] As the technology becomes increasingly common, it becomes manufactured through a repeatable process — it is more defined and better understood\. Whilst there exists differentiation, particularly in the early stages, there is increasing stability and sameness\. You will often see many of the same product\.

\[38\] As technology stabilises, the differentiation disappears as scale and volume operations of production create highly standardised, defined and fixed fit for a specific known purpose and for repetition, repetition and more repetition\. It is a result of a ruthless removal of deviation, on industrialisation, and operational efficiency\. It is something that we become habituated to and is increasingly less visible — so much so that we often forget it’s even there\.

\[39\] Whilst we only see this in a limited aspect today with the increasingly popular programmatic marketing — which ‘simply’ provides an automated bidding on advertising inventory in real time, for the opportunity to show an ad to a specific customer, in a specific context and a specific time — it is easily perceived that other organisational operations, from accounting to sales enablement, will also undergo similar technology based function overhauls\.

\[47\] The idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organisations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing \(or service\) organisation as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs\. Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources — money, labour, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management\. How value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits\.
