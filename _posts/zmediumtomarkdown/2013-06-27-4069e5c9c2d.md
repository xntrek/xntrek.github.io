## All animals are cats

In looking after animals \- both as pets and in the production of food \- I have come to a conclusion\. All animals are cats\.

It’s a strange thing to say, but since the majority of people are familiar with the cat and dog polarity of animal behavior it is a an easy goto analogy\.

Humans have a unique tendency to attribute human characteristics to inanimate objects, animals, forces of nature, and others\. This personification, or anthropomorphism, is something that has helped the species to relate to and explain the world around them\.

However, due to the empathic nature of humans, they can suffer from anthropomorphic error in which the attribution of human thoughts, feelings, or motives are imparted upon non humans\. This is predominantly noticed when humans relate to animals, especially as way of explaining their behavior or comfort\. This is a most dangerous aspect of human animal interaction, often to the animal’s detriment\. Animals do not think nor react in the same way that humans do\.

Why? Because animals are not humans\.

In the process of applying human values to animals you invalidate the animals very nature and employ upon them an unrealistic set of behavioral expectations\.

Having stated this fact, let me couch it with this statement; They are still living beings and deserve to be treated humanely and with respect\.

In not attributing human characteristics to animals, we must therefore look at how Animals think, how they react and in doing so, it provides us with the clues of how they learn\.

Consider that they don’t understand English, they can’t read books nor attend lectures\.

They are motived by instincts, and the learn by experience\.

Dogs can be trained in two ways \- through positive or negative reinforcement\. Since as humans, there is the tendancy to react to negative reinforcement, the training of dogs utilising these methods seems easy, and thus leads to the illusion of dogs being able to be trained and understand humans\. Yet, when people utilise the same techniques on cats, it fails to be successful in any way and thus gives rise to the myth that cats cannot be trained\.

However cats are only trainable through one method \- and that is through positive reinforcement\. It should not be that surprising to find that they react exceedingly well to rewarding and pleasurable interactions\. This is true of all animals\. From bovines to ovines I have found this technique to be successful\.

I never assume the animal wants anything to do with the plans I have for it\. It does not care about my motivations\. It does not have a desire to have anything to do with me … and why should any animal have anything to do with us? What are we offering them?

My cat loves me\.

Well, at least, that is how I prefer to interpret its actions\. Truth is, it is happy to be rewarded with food, shelter and grooming that is part of the interaction it has with me\. It is pleasurable\. It is beneficial to it’s continued existence\. I am under no delusion that if I stopped feeding it or that if I was to offer it unpleasant interactions that it will walk out and seek a new more pleasurable existence\.

To the surprise of many, perhaps, pigs are much the same\. Provide them with shelter, food, and social interaction and they are as happy as … well, pigs\.

I find it curious how people perceive a utopian existence for our porcine friends is based on a sparse population spread across wide open fields\. Why? They were forest animals before we domesticated them\. They have very little hair covering, an inability to cool themselves down and a susceptibility to exposure based discomfort\. Further, they are a highly social animal, needing the interaction of family units to remain relaxed\. Why would anyone want to remove that from their existence?

As humans we have a well developed ability to empathise, and we can extend that empathy beyond our species\. This is a great and wonderful aspect that should be applauded\. However, let us never confuse the ability to have empathy with the assumption that animals want what we would want in their place\.

So, I say, treat them as cats \- allow them to be the animals they are\. In doing so, they will be happy\. Happy animals are healthy animals\. Regardless if they are pets or food, it is what is best\.
