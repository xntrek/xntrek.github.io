## eating is inherently unethical

_Consider this: The act of eating, by simple definition, is the incorporation into the eater of the autonomy of the eaten\. Through the collection, preparation and mastication there is no other way to describe it, this is a violent destructive act of that living autonomy\._

If the consumption of any matter requires the taking of life, is it impossible to eat ethically? Is it possible to subsist on a diet of ingredients that were never alive to begin with and whose destruction doesn’t have a negative impact on living organisms?

Regardless of your worldly socioeconomic position, it is fairly safe to assume that we are all bound by a set of rules — be they symbolic, traditional or value based — that surround our consumption\.

The great majority of these rules have traditionally been handed down and bound by the evolution of historical or geographical memes in the form of religious or cultural guidelines\.

Even in this modern day western world where political correctness and an embracing attitude exist, relatively few consumption guidelines are based on laws\. Of those laws that do exist, the greatest majority are focused on the governance of public safety, sanitation and, \(increasingly in this modern age\) sustaining or protection of ecological resources\.
