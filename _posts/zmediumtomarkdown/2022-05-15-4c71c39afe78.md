### Web3 and the Dark Patterns of Design
#### Understanding Design Ethic choices as a way forward\.
#### Preface

With the recent wave of “new” technologies that are becoming popular as part of the “web3” surge that is being promoted as societally transformative, the questions of ethics and design should once again be at the forefront of our minds\.

To be clear, when I speak of design, I don’t mean a constrained definition of graphics, visuals or aesthetics — but the very nature of what we build, how we build it, why we build it and probably most importantly — what happens when we have built it\.

There are plenty of examples over the last two decades to demonstrate why we need to keep having these discussions — from interface layouts designed to manipulate us, to the algorithms which had adverse impacts on our mental health, our politics, and our lives through to the big news items like the Cambridge Analytica scandal which rocked Facebook and moved the conversation about data collection and privacy to the global stage\.

Nor is this a new topic — there have been numerous articles, books and documentaries which have come out in recent years about these topics\. They told us the stories, they showed us the effects and they left a bunch of questions to the technologists sitting up in the air about what had happened — questions like:
- Had they thought about whether they were coding addictive products?
- Did they understand their platforms were beginning to push us into our own filter bubbles, and polarize us further?
- Did they realize their platforms could be weaponized to shape elections?
- Did they know their platforms weren’t just the pipes that allowed content to run through them?


There’s a lot we can learn from the good and bad of the last generation of technology as we hurtle towards this next phase\. Web3 promises a more immersive experience with technology, framed with a word that’s now become mainstream vernacular: the metaverse\. The term has different definitions depending on who you ask, but a basic way to understand its meaning is to think about living in a world that’s more interactive\.

However, I don’t want to talk about that — there are going to be plenty of articles and discussions on the emergence of innovations and technologies that will deliver this promised decentralised online ecosystem\. However, like social media and the “connection” tools of Web 2\.0 before it, Web3 is being represented as a means of wresting control away from corrupt or malign political interests held by the techno\-dominant\.

While I don’t want to espouse cynicism nor add to the hype, I do believe that there is nothing inherently magical about Web3\.

There is one thing that web3 does have though — a bunch of designers — be they existing organisations, emerging entrepreneurs, technologists or eXperience Designers — who will shape the industry, and through the interaction with it, the very society we participate in\.

Thus, what I do want to talk about is that we are, yet again, at a pivotal point where we have the opportunity to once again take a “humanity first” approach as we drive these innovations\. We have an opportunity to step back, look at our past and take the lessons from the last decade and ask the human questions before it’s too late\.

To do this, I want to rehash some of the ideas we have skimmed around over the last few decades\.
### Part 1: It’s deeper than you think

As designers, we have the luxury to help shape the future, and it’s important to remember how design can have a far\-reaching impact\.

The truth is, our work can be exploitative or negligent, our work can perpetuate inequality if we only focus and appeal to a certain subset of the population\. This is before we even discuss if it’s used to create psychologically conforming, transforming or addictive products\.

From a single touchpoint to a full organisational design, we have unique and often unregulated powers that bestow designers with the ability to implement changes that can affect behaviours and actions\.

Therefore, we can presuppose that politics, ethics, and social responsibility can not be separated from our work as professional designers\.

When we get things like the Uber Executive scandals, Cambridge Analytics or even the effects of systemic racism, It’s important to consider how those things came to be\.
- Was it due to privileged white men drunk on power?
- Was it the development of a systemic propaganda model funded by the wealthy?
- Was it just bad design?


Taking these factors into consideration, we need to take a step back and think about, what we consider dark patterns and whether we have moral obligations to evaluate our design decisions\. Consider:
- What is the role of politics, ethics, and social responsibility?
- What do we reflect and scrutinise as ‘dark patterns’?
- Do we have any ethical imperatives to uphold?


**_We have unique and often unregulated powers that bestow us with the ability to implement changes that can affect behaviours and actions\._**

#### Dark Patterns are not digital phenomena\.

When the term “Dark Patterns” is used, there seems to be a general consensus on what dark patterns are:
- A Digital Phenomena
- Focussed on User Interfaces
- Everyday “Common Use” Ethical issues



![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*zNz_Fgi-aMKf64pb)


There is a definition published in “Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites” which states:


> _“_ dark patterns are interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making decisions that, if fully informed and capable of selecting alternatives, they might not make\. _”_ 





With the simple redaction of only two words, it can be better aimed toward a more baseline conversation on the ethics of design\.


> _“_ dark patterns are **design** choices that **benefit a service** by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into **making decisions** that, if fully informed and capable of selecting alternatives, **they might not make** \. _”_ 





Think about businesses with subscription or lock\-in models \(e\.g\. telecom, utility companies, banks, pension funds, etc\) who upon creating new plans that improve or discount their product don’t automatically apply these improvements in functionality or price to their existing customers — often this is a deliberate decision — enforced as a pattern internally referred to as “the lazy tax”\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*DN2hJqhAeOKibspc)


Then there is the “reverse lottery” pattern\. Where an organisation attracts customers with great deals, but they are _conditional_ on the customer remembering to do something _seemingly trivial_ \(e\.g\. printing a physical boarding pass, or turning off data roaming when overseas\) \. The company set the “penalty” price of failing to remember, so high that even if only a few customers fail, the company can still make enough money to finance the low prices that attract more customers\.
#### How Did We Get Here?

It is easy to lay all the blame at the feet of organisations and the need for meeting some kind of metric or revenue goal at the expense of any other consideration\.

Yet the truth is, that we have influences from:
- society,
- legal and regulatory boundaries,
- political \(and these days let’s just call _all media_ political\-engines\) and of course,
- cultural elements,


and they all play a part in the way we perceive, interpret and justify a variety of actions and behaviours\.
#### Values vs Genomes

Many organisations lay claim to what they want to be\. They spout purpose, culture, and values\. Often, that effort is ineffective\.

Many futurists will look at the past to see patterns and influences on the present, and what that means for tomorrow\.

A common theme in any such investigation is that humans seek to fit in with their peers — both current and past\.

The same pattern may have you discover that in any organisation, they are a product of:
- the precedent of previous decisions, and
- the actual decisions they make next\.


To see what any organisation is — or will be — **simply ask one question** :
- What other decisions have we made that look like this one?



> _“_ We are what we repeatedly do\. _” — Aristotle_ 





That is _what_ they are\. The _true_ genome of an entity\.

Hanlon’s Razor is a tongue\-in\-cheek observation that unpleasant situations are usually the result of thoughtlessness, rather than a deliberate attempt to ruin your day\.

When highlighted, often the explanation provided is it was unintentional\. That due to technological, procedural or regulatory limitations, users are simply experiencing an anti\-pattern\. It looks like a dark pattern — but used in error\.

There are some basic heuristics that ring true, and often may not be perceived as coming from dark pattern behaviours\.
#### When being human\-centric backfires

Many of us are so focused on being human\-centric and undertaking to determine the user value — so when aligned to the business value, then the offering provides a win\-win situation for both sides of the proposition, right?

The trouble is, that the things that really matter to humans — safety, happiness, belonging, and love — are almost impossible to measure or deliver\.

And yet, we come up with models to try and define, measure and deliver these “values”\.

Regardless, we keep doing this and believe that products and services are able to deliver fundamental elements of value\.

We classify them as being the **RATIONAL** needs of **CONSERVATION** ; **SELF\-ENHANCEMENT** ; **OPENNESS\-TO\-CHANGE** and **SELF\-TRANSCENDENCE** \.

Or we may utilise a different language and state they provide **EMOTIVE** needs classified as **FUNCTIONAL** ; **EMOTIONAL** ; **LIFE\-CHANGING** ; and providing **SOCIAL IMPACT** \.

In general, we believe that the more elements we can \(or at least convince users that we do\) provide, the greater the customer’s loyalty to the offering will be\.

Thus we enter into a new world …
#### Behavioural Economics


> “… studies the effects of psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions and how those decisions vary from those implied by classical theory\.” — Definition from Wikipedia\. 





This isn’t _just_ pseudoscience\. Behavioural Economics exploded as a discipline, especially after 2002 when psychologist Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences “ _for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision\-making under uncertainty_ ”\.

While Behavioural Economics exploded as a discipline, book releases since 2005 have been supersonic, and it has been heavily referenced in Marketing, Sales, and yes, even Design\.

It’s a multidisciplinary field, but the area that is most easily understood at a high level is the psychological or more precisely, the cognitive and emotional triggers\. Utilising these triggers is tempting to businesses because they’re easier to understand and often a quick route to results\. Organisations are increasingly requesting that Behavioural Economics practice is used to increase the sales of their offerings\.

The two most common themes grasped/focussed on:
- **Heuristics** : Humans make 95% of their decisions using mental shortcuts or rules of thumb\.
- **Framing** : The collection of anecdotes and stereotypes that make up the mental filters individuals rely on to understand and respond to events\.


To put this another way, humans are easily influenced through the use of cognitive bias’ and good narratives\.

This led to the idea of **Persuasive Design** which, when used responsibly, can leverage a good understanding of cognitive science to add value to a user’s experience and increase user engagement\.

Nudging \(as it was originally defined\) is a psychological function of any attempt at influencing people’s judgment, choice or behaviour in a predictable way, that is made possible because of cognitive limitations, biases, routines, and habits in individual and social decision\-making\. It is posing barriers for people to perform rationally in their own self\-declared interests\.


> _“_ A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives\. _”_ — Thaler & Sunstein 2008, p\. 6 





Ross Floate sums it up well\. We are placing dangerous tools in the hands of the naive\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*yLE7QLKjDHl1X7ne)


All of a sudden the psychological data, especially around Heuristics, where these cognitive biases become tools for persuasion becomes available freely to all of us…

**The question is what happens when we use design to actively change the behaviour and choices of users?**


> _“_ Bias improves predictability, by limiting possibility _” — Anonymous_ 




#### Nudge or Manipulation?


> _“_ Designers have a responsibility, not only to themselves and to their clients, but also to the wider world\. We are designers because we love to create, but creation without responsibility breeds destruction\. Every day, designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them\. This needs to change\. _” — Mike Monteiro, Ruined by Design_ 





When is a design choice a nudge, and when is it manipulation?
- Social Media Platforms that tell us when our friends have “liked” something, encouraging us to do the same?
- UI Dark patterns that trigger preferences for shiny buttons over grey ones?
- Platforms that show us products others have bought before us?
- Apps that gamify sharing or encourage us to continue a “streak” with friends?


I used to say that Behavioural Economics was the weaponisation of cognitive bias’ for commercial gain, but have we done the same with persuasive design?

To define a transparent nudge — any nudge part of an intervention — then those affected should be able to infer three things:
1. Who is the choice architect \(agent\)?
2. What is the intention behind the intervention?\(What is the intended end?\)
3. How the intervention is supposed to nudge the user’s \(my\) behaviour?


On the other hand, anything that is working in a way that those nudged cannot reconstruct the architect, intention, or the means by which behavioural change is pursued is effectively manipulation\.
#### Are we the Evil Designers?


> “Not me\! I’m not an evil Designer\!” — every designer 





Part of our role is to consider multiple perspectives\. We have to assume that we are suffering the Donning\-Kruger cognitive bias effect as far as our own thinking goes\. We need to seek out the areas of our ignorance and shine a light on them\.


> _“_ A designer’s job is to consider many sides of the same scenario, but this becomes more difficult as the number of scenarios grow\. Even the best of us make terrible decisions because we forget, don’t understand, or aren’t aware of the consequences\. _” —_ Linnéa Strid 





Every single designer could easily make a decision that ruins thousands of people’s lives\.


> _“_ Power corrupts the few, while weakness corrupts the many\. _” — Eric Hoffer_ 





Initially written in a different context, I want to take Hoffer’s quote and consider it from the point of Design\. What would it look like if we aimed to empower the many instead?

If we take Hoffer’s intention of “ _Our healing gift to the weak is the capacity for self\-help\. We must learn how to impart to them the technical, social, and political skills which would enable them to get bread, human dignity, freedom, and strength by their own efforts\._ ” as part of our base concept of design where it was unbiased, empowering and aimed for the fringe\-users before the masses\.

We make these decisions \(that possibly ruin thousands of people’s lives\) every day, and often delegate them away through our own dark or anti\-patterns\. We call them edge cases\.

**These “edge cases” are where we risk doing the most damage and are what we will discuss in Part 2\.**
### Part 2: The fallacy of Edge Cases
#### Who decides?

So, let’s look at what an edge case is often defined _as a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme \(maximum or minimum\) operating parameter\._

An Operating Parameter\.

They’re not users or people, they are simply arguments outside of the parameters\.

However parameters **ARE** arbitrary, aren’t they?


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*_rMzsmEMYsLTAOAA)


Or perhaps it is simply an oppressive design choice?

After all:
- Who picked the grouping?
- Who determined the size?
- Who decided that was enough?


The ultimate “decider” is the “choice architect” for the design\.


> _“_ When you call something an edge case, you’re really just defining the limits of what you care about\. **”** — Eric Meyer 





I get why we make these “edge case” decisions\. We need to set boundaries\. We might not have the skill, technology, the budget to stretch that far or even timebox limitations\. The realities of technology at scale mean that the services we build, and use must necessarily be designed in a way that constrains the options, and user choices\.

Right?

However, the shadow side is sometimes enforced through the use of creation of market placement and maintaining exclusivity or simply, ensuring a higher profit margin\.
- **Limitations … or … Market Placement?**
- **Boundaries … or … Exclusivity?**
- **Budget … or … Profit?**



![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*UV8PaFZCn1LcyZx4)



> _“_ 1% of two billion people, which most products would consider an edge case, is twenty million people\. Those are the people at the margins\. **_”_** _— Mike Monteiro_ 





Should we be asking questions then?
- Can we include everyone?
- If not, then what?
- Can we add them later?
- When?



![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*iKN88b7DfMOzfwVQ)


Remember that we often create limitations by our design choices\.
- Technology hijacks the way we perceive choices and replaces them with new ones\. e\.g\. Users can only click on the buttons or select the options presented to them;
- Users can only opt\-out of the options provided to them \(to opt\-out\) \.


And that we also often do this as part of the market placement\.
- The power of design to manipulate user choices is, at best, akin to a magician’s misdirection\.
- It provides people with the illusion of free choice while architecting those choices so that the service wins\. Often no matter what is actually chosen\.


Again, this is not purely in the domain of the digital world\. Consider the “free choice” to follow KPIs, choose housing finance or even transportation\. The boundaries we create can create a false sense of exclusivity\. At a minimum, the power of design means that choices do not always reflect real personal preferences\. The budgets we work against may also be fuelling an unproportionate drive for profit\. At worst, online platforms manipulate us into keeping the data flowing, fueling an information\-hungry business model\.
#### What are our design choices saying?

If you look at the concept of the edge case again, we need to ask ourselves the message we give in defining it as, _a problem_ or _a situation_ \.
- A _problem_ is something that _causes issues_ and _merits solving_
- A _situation_ is something _temporary_ and _defined by surroundings_ \(context\)


So, are we effectively saying that when we define a user as an edge case,
- you cause issues,
- you are a problem to be solved,
- your identity is temporary and defined by your surroundings\.


Is this the message we want to be sent to our communities and users?

There are plenty of examples of “edge cases” that have gone wrong though, even if they may simply have been biased oversights\.
- A heteronormative designer may never consider how group privacy settings could involuntarily out a user’s sexual or relationship preferences\. — [https://www\.adweek\.com/digital/facebook\-groups\-wall\-street\-journal\-gay/](https://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-groups-wall-street-journal-gay/){:target="_blank"}
- Designers with a eurocentric view might forget that the concept of “first and last name” is different depending on country and culture\. — [https://www\.kalzumeus\.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods\-programmers\-believe\-about\-names/](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/){:target="_blank"}
- A technology\-centric designer may insist on utilising high\-quality images\. Unintentionally making surfing the web unaffordable and difficult for those with expensive data plans\. — [https://www\.forbes\.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/05/the\-cost\-of\-mobile\-internet\-around\-the\-world\-infographic/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/05/the-cost-of-mobile-internet-around-the-world-infographic/){:target="_blank"}

#### How do we do better?

Who holds the power to define what’s missing?

**_We all do\._**

We should never presume that we already know _anything\._

We should aim for continued insights and lifelong learning\.


> _“_ …if you just ask, ‘Who are we missing,’ early and often, you are able to better identify one of the ways that bias is subtly influencing the decision… who are the people missing from this boardroom table, from this design sprint? Who are the people who’re missing in our hiring practice? And it allows you to do it in a way that you can challenge your own bias, in a way that doesn’t mean you have to feel ashamed for having a bias\. _” — Benjamin Evans, Inclusive Design Lead at Airbnb_ 





But we should also go beyond _who_ and into the _what_ and _where_ \.

There are so many aspects that can be affected by the choices we make\. To the individuals, their culture, mental health, their physical and social environment\. We should spend the time to consider those elements\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*EkLZrr7iwoP74OxD)


To gain insights and learnings from every part we affect or have an effect on\.
### Part 3: Intent does not erase Impact

Do you know what the legally binding definition of the difference between murder and manslaughter is?

[_Intent_](https://www.ag.gov.au/crime/publications/commonwealth-criminal-code-guide-practitioners-draft/part-22-elements-offence/division-5-fault-elements/52-intention){:target="_blank"} _\._

Do you know what the difference is for the victim?

_None_ \. The _impact_ is the same\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/1*cTMhhHixizeG1eT-BEVIKw.png)


Admittedly a morbid example — this is the clearest way I can explain the role of a Designer’s ideas and the effect of their decision making\.

In recent years, we have all seen or heard a version of the excuse phrase, “But that’s not what I meant” or “But that’s not how we meant for it to be used”\.


> _“When we were making the like button, our entire motivation was ‘can we spread positivity and love in the world?’ The idea that fast forward to today and teens would be getting depressed when they don’t have enough likes or it could be leading to political polarisation was nowhere on our radar\.” —_ Justin Rosenstein 





It doesn’t matter if your intent was to create something **_benevolent_** if the impact is **_malevolent\._**

This begs two questions:
1. How do we define intent and impact in design?
In a nutshell, intent refers to what you thought you were doing\.
Impact refers to how that action was deemed by the other parties\.
2. How do we determine \(future or unintentional\) impact?
That’s going to need more of an explanation\. So, let’s get into it\.

#### What something is designed for — isn’t what it is always used for\.

Could we start with a premise that all good things, can become bad things?

We may set out to design something for a specific purpose only to discover that the people we designed it for are not using it as intended\. Or we may discover a hidden feature that benefits us, and we use it as a tool it wasn’t originally intended to be used\. However, as stated before, we, as designers, often don’t think that far ahead\.
#### We have a moral responsibility for solving these problems — before they are\.

It is part of the responsibility of the designer to look for solutions\. It is also the responsibility to look for misuse, distortion, unintended consequences and leapfrog scenarios that solutions may create\. We need to look for ways to make things better\.

Let’s start with a basic formula:


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*UMKsJm20T2Cz_C4E)


**The INTENT** \[of our design\] **does not erase the IMPACT** \[of its use\] **\.**

Similarly, \[the needs of the\] **CREATOR does not erase** \[the needs of the\] **USER\.**

\[The application of a design or technology\] **LIMITATION does not erase** \[the effect of\] **EXCLUSION** \[of any party\] \.
#### But … How do you define intent?

Having an intention is nothing but having a desire to perform a certain action and a belief that one will perform this action\. When it comes to design, we are often really discussing “prospective intentions”, also known as “prior intentions”, involving plans for the future\. That said, it is rarely ever defined or communicated and never explored for negative attributes or distortion\.

Think about any organisation\. There are many amazing advancements\. They may have found a cure to an illness\. Lives may have been saved through a technological breakthrough, or the breakthrough might now help thousands of families thrive\. However, think about what else may have happened with those advancements\. The cure to an illness may have unleashed some nasty side effects\. The lifesaving breakthrough may have come at the cost of another safety feature\. The gap between the families that thrive and those that subsist becomes larger\.

Could these effects have been foreseen?

Could we have been more cautious?

Could we define a framework to make sure that the effects of the decision were weighted, and that the good outweighs the bad?
#### OK, so how do I imagine the impacts of my designs? Education is key\.

There are _always_ ‘Hidden Rules’\.

Hidden, more often due to ignorance than some form of arcane knowledge or conspiracy\.

When designing, are you aware of who you are designing _as_ ?

Do you truly understand who you are designing _for_ ?

If you are in a group, be it any group\. Social, class, geographic, or other identifiers, you understand the hidden rules of that group \(even if you cannot vocalise them\) and the danger is, you take these for granted that they are either understood by or work the same for everyone\.

For example, take sociological classes\. The table below, from ‘A Framework for Understanding Poverty’ by Dr Ruby Payne, explores the disconnect amongst the Fiscal classes of these unspoken cues and habits of the “understandings” of each term and concept within a social \(class\) group\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*dnwXwJpuJq2UfzQA)


My questions for you are:
- Are you aware of where you sit?
- Do you understand the “rules” you assume to be true?
- Are you challenging those “rules” in your assumptions?
- Can you see the intersections?


Regardless of which country or race or gender, certain things happen when resources are in short supply\. The _fewer_ the resources, the more a person lives on the left\-hand side of the following chart\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*D3mZUzODiUgwoVOL)


The _greater_ the resources, the more a person lives on the right\-hand side of the chart\.

_Resources are always on a continuum and are not static\._

They fluctuate and may change over a lifetime\.
- When designing, are you aware of what part of the resource continuum you are designing in, for, or around?
- Is it a constrained resource?
- Is that resource a limitation?
- Or does the resource limit the users?
- Alternatively, what is the impact and does it create exclusion?


Let’s be clear here\. This is a big topic, and there are far too many examples we can go through, from the multitude available in “ [Invisible Women](https://g.co/kgs/SqBQDo){:target="_blank"} ” and “ [Coded Bias](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11394170/){:target="_blank"} ” through to numerous examples revealing themselves daily on social media platforms, and with the ever enlightening social awakenings\. The only answer is a lifetime journey of continuous learning and exploration\.
#### How do I map out my intentions against the unintended or distorted uses?

That’s a great question, with quite a few answers, which we should discuss next\.
### Part 4: Do Better, Shine Bright\.
#### Did you do a Dark?


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*TnRN5-xqtY32O2VA)


Every day, all over the world, we work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around us\.

**_We_ need to change\. _We_ need to take responsibility\.**

Let’s be honest\. It’s a known aspect of human behaviour that the more _difficult_ something is, the _greater_ the level of motivation, that is the effort, that is required for action to occur\.

It is for this reason that sometimes the need for persuasive design kicks in to add value to a user’s experience and increase user engagement\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*R6teL8DwRQodMZk6)


I look at four elements when analysing a service to define if it is a dark pattern:
1. Was it deliberate? \(apply Hanlon’s Razor\)
2. Am I being misinformed? \(consider Persuasive Principles\)
3. Did the deception improve my experience? \(apply White Lies Principles\)
4. Who benefits most from this? \(Cui bono? where does it sit on the Benefits Chart?\)



> _“_ The intended outcome shouldn’t be deemed unethical if the persuasion were undertaken without the technology\. _” as published in the article ‘Toward an Ethics of Persuasive Technology’ by Daniel Berdichevsky & Erik Neuenschwander_ 






![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*HyrD17OtL4kInY5h)


If you are doing it in the analogue world, then transferring that same practice and behaviour into the technologically delivered world _should be ethically identical\._

Imagine an airline automatically adding travel insurance to customers' carts, without permission and giving no way of removing that item\. If you were at a Flight Centre desk and they did that, would you accept the invoice? Chances are you’d ask them to remove it, right?

So, I’m not saying that all persuasive design is evil\. But you can first ask yourself one question though:
- Are you aiming to improve the user’s experience?


To this end, [Dan Turner came up with a set of heuristic principles](https://alistapart.com/article/design-white-lies-ethics/){:target="_blank"} to help you choose “ _white lies_ ” that are designed for the user’s benefit\.

If you want to determine if you are up to no good, ask yourself:
- Cui Bono — To whom is it a benefit? 
Who benefits _most_ from this?


Identifying the people who benefit from the technique and who benefits most, can give you some insight into the motivation of the creator\. This is based on Chris Nodder’s four categories of design from his book ‘ _Evil by Design_ ’:
- Charitable design benefits society above all others\.
- Motivational design benefits the user above all others\.
- Commercial design benefits the creator and the user equally\.
- If the creators are getting significantly more out of the exchange than the user, they have only their own interests at heart\. Their work falls into the “ _evil_ ” category\.



![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/1*aziiZ-aYhIEvYdqjOVxrcw.png)


The concept of evil is a strong word and sentiment, but it is basically summarised by when business needs are placed too far above user needs and design expertise\. As workers, it can be difficult to push back on those priorities, forcing a moral and ethical dilemma\.

For the Stoics, I can suggest something that Aristotle wrote down over two thousand years ago\. In those times when you need to provide effective persuasion against that request from the executives or to meet a KPI measure that creates an unfavourable outcome, think about the constructs of logos, ethos, and pathos:
- Logos is the application of reason and logic\.


Which is extremely important but ineffective on its own\. It needs to be complemented by:
- ethos, which is an appeal based on the character of the individual\(s\), and
- pathos, an appeal to emotions\.


Or to use the modern English equivalents: **_Logic, Ethics and Empathy\._**
#### Think: Future\!?

As designers, we have the responsibility to “ _see something, say something, do something_ ” for the impact of our designs\.

That responsibility is as true of the immediate effects, as it is of potential, or future, effects of those designs\.

If we don’t, are we not in fact making a choice through inaction?

For most designers, we garner inspiration from various sources\. Futurism and science\-fiction often provide a catalyst for some explorative thinking about the ways something can make our lives better …\. and how it can all go wrong\.

The process of utilising a series of diverging and converging steps is a key element of Design Thinking, but ultimately it converges into a concrete concept that is tested, finalized, and brought to market\.

Futures Thinking, on the other hand, yields a series of scenarios, which are meant to illustrate multiple options for what the future might be without defining an exact prediction\. They can be many things, but often, as a start, they can be Optimistic, Pessimistic, Utopian or downright Dystopian\.


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*w1KuGqGMXdUHXYG-)

- Both processes should look to the fringes as a source of inspiration\.
- Both processes utilise personas and prototypes to bring abstract concepts to life\.


Futures thinking is not about _forecasts_ , but _scenarios_ \.

It’s an interdisciplinary “ _collection of methods, theories, and findings_ ” that helps people to think constructively about the future\. It has previously been summed up as “ _the rigorous art of imagining_ ” with applied expressions\. The goal is to think bigger about opportunities we may \(or may not\) have in the coming years\. It aims to inform strategies for tomorrow and make them more robust for the uncertainty that lies ahead\. So we need to look at the Optimistic, Pessimistic, Utopian, and Dystopian variations with an open mind in each case\.
#### Think: Magic\!?

Experts are still surprised and _disrupted_ by “ _impossible_ ” changes\. We need to keep pushing the envelope\. Pushing past the obvious, and back into chaos\. I find [Arthur C\. Clarke’s **three laws**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws){:target="_blank"} still relevant in today’s organisations\.
- When a distinguished but elderly expert states that something is possible, they are almost certainly right\. When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong\.
- The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible\.
- Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\.


**But Beware\!**


![](/assets/4c71c39afe78/0*ElsM7odvEsrjIEYM)


The problem with magic, it relies on secrecy to remain mystical\! And just like magic, we keep trying to create black box secrets that can lead us down dark paths\. The “black box” effect can itself become a form of dark patterns\.
#### Think: Dystopian?

What I am asking you as designers, architects, and choice makers, is to try and understand all potential impacts\.

**Always Question:** “I _s this really the right thing to do?_ ”

Depending on your age and pop culture exposure, think like:

1\. Philip K\. Dick — The American Sci\-Fi writer known for his work that explored philosophical, social, and political themes, with stories dominated by monopolistic corporations, alternative universes, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness whose calling cards included:
- Explore the messier aspects of human nature\.
- Consider the dark sides of identity and perception\.
- Never assume that order and stability are good\.
- Be Paranoid — assume shadowy forces want to corrupt your vision\.
- Assume all power corrupts — what happens when absolute power is given?



> “ _Just because something bears the aspect of the inevitable one should not, therefore, go along willingly with it\._ ” 





2\. Gremlins \(some call them children\) \. Just like the Mogwai, your design is about kindness, thoughtfulness and goodness, but there are rules, aren’t there?
- You brought this little Gremlin into the world\.
- You gave it the best intentions and all the thoughtfulness you could muster\.
- What happens when someone doesn’t treat it the way you expect?
- What could go wrong?
- Can you prevent that?
- How do you define \(and enforce\) the rules so that a set of circumstances don’t turn your Mogwai into a Gremlin nightmare?



> _“You do with Mogwai what your society has done with all of nature’s gifts\! You do not understand\! You are not ready\!” — Mr Wing_ 





Ok, a more modern analogy, and this is the last one, I promise:

3\. Give it the Black Mirror treatment\. German philosopher and political theorist Herbert Marcuse claimed that, developing technology institutes new, more effective, and more pleasant forms of social control and social cohesion, making totalitarian control through terrorisation unnecessary\.

Black Mirror personified this as stories about technology as an opiate, fuelling stories beyond the edge\. So grab your people, and workshop a look through our modern society\. Drive your concept to the edge of it, and ask the questions to explore the scenarios:
- What could be the unanticipated consequences?
- What might abuse look like?
- How could paranoia and dystopia interact with it?
- What would it look like if the masses took to it as their opioid?



> _“If technology is a drug — and it does feel like a drug — then what, precisely, are the side effects? This area — between delight and discomfort — is where Black Mirror, \[…\] is set \[…\] on every wall, on every desk, in the palm of every hand: the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitor, a smartphone\.” — Charlie Brooker, creator of Black Mirror_ 





So, what would I ask you in a review to evaluate your thinking and design choices?
#### **What if everyone did what you are about to do?**
- Would the world be better or worse for it?
- Could you roll it back?
- Could others use this to springboard or justify another initiative?

#### **What is the role of the recipients in the system?**
- Are you treating them as individuals with goals?
- Are their goals more important than your own?

#### **_Are you maximising happiness for the greatest number of recipients?_ \***
- What are the consequences and the impacts of the choices made on them?
- How do you assess or measure happiness\*?
- Do you utilise the impact measurements to make improvements?


\*Where happiness = Positive Outcomes
#### **Would you be happy for this to be published in tomorrow’s papers?**
- If you had no say in the article?
- If your name is specifically mentioned?
- How would your friends and family view your work?


Fighting “ _those bad or evil people_ ” may give us the satisfaction of righteous indignation and moral superiority\. It however will not solve an actual problem\. When it comes to unethical design, whether it is at a societal level like egalitarian rights, wealth distribution at an organisational level, or a single app screen\. We fundamentally need to ensure a better system is used, by ensuring that it is fair, balanced, and equitable at its core\.


> “Don’t measure your performance by what you have accomplished, but by what you should have accomplished within your capabilities\.” — Jeroen De Flander 




### What does this mean for us today?

One of the key messages from the likes of Gavin Wood, the person who coined the Web3 moniker, is that the metaverse and innovations which will come from the web3 philosophy and building blocks will address “the failures of technology” over the last decades\.

Some will say that the failures of the past are a failure of regulation, but the answer isn’t better regulation; there needs to be a new layer of technology because regulatory failures are inevitable\.

But are we really talking about a failure of technology?

Libertarians will tell us that a failure of governance and regulation and competition policy from the past proves that we are better off with greater autonomy, freedom of choice, and individualism to manage our way forward\.

Yet, I would argue that as with previous industrial revolutions, we have seen a pattern of behaviour — whether intentional or not — where those in the forefront of the hype are privatising the gains, but essentially socialising the pains\.

If we want a world where this perceived level of unconfined individualism, freedom of choice, and unfettered autonomy exists — then we need some basic understanding, an agreement if you will, of the rules by which we will foster, if not adhere to, as we bravely forge ahead on this path\.

That is where we, the designers of these pathways come in\.

It is our job to consider the outcomes and impacts of our choices\. Not for today, nor just for a select community or set of users — but for those that come tomorrow and those that are affected beyond the immediate interactions of the services\.

We need to be aware that our design decisions are beyond those of how we shape service or the way one experiences it\. The very nature of the business model, the way we make decisions, the choices we accept and those we do not question\.

Yes, addressing them would be messy, and if we don’t we will find that just like those that came before, the next set of founders of these platforms will again take far too long to build teams and processes to answer a simple question — it’s the ultimate question that was asked in the previous decades, was the instigator of those articles, books and documentaries, and will again be asked in that next documentary that discusses your work —


> **“What went wrong?”** 




and


> “How could you have prevented this?” 




In every step you take, in every decision you make, I want you to think about those two questions and understand if you could explain your choices? How will you answer those questions when the time comes to defend your design choices?
