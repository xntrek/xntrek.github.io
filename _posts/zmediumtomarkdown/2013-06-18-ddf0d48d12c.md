## Just the polarising statements ma’am
#### are facts less important than conversation starters?

I was raised to believe that one keeps their mouth closed until they had all the facts\.

“It is _better_ to remain _silent_ at the risk of being _thought a fool_ , than to talk and remove all doubt of it”

In fact, if at all possible, all sides of the story should be researched and presented\. This lesson was reiterated in the school system with balance being important aspects of presenting information in the form of argumentative essays or scientific reporting\.

Yet, in the world of writing — of audience engagement and participation — this is seemingly becoming an anomaly of the past\. Journalists, bloggers and the audience savvy seem to be aware that presenting a balanced view with the cold hard facts leaves no room for polarity\.

_Without polarity, there can be no angry rants or retorts\._

People need to be moved to react\. Reactions get likes, they get comments, they get shared links and they get recommendations\.

_Reactions get people talking\._

Yes, even if it is just to call you names …

So, should we stick to the facts? Or just be authors of conversation starters?
