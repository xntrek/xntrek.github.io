#### What is a great hire?

Is competence enough? Is it enough to determine a potential employee has the necessary skills, experiences and education deemed to be the right formula to successfully complete the tasks needed? Does past history predict future performance? How can one assess if an individual has the potential for growth? Or that they have the ability and willingness to take on more responsibility?

When I first became responsible for hiring individuals, my mentor gave me a formula that I should concentrate on in evaluating individuals and decide who was a great hire \-


> _capability x \(commitment \+ chemistry\) \._ 




- Capability — the knowledge and skills to do the job\.
- Commitment — the attitude and motivation to do the job effectively
- Chemistry — the personality, values and work styles that best “fit” the organisation’s culture \(or the strength to be a change agent towards the culture you are aiming for\) \.


That formula stood me in pretty good stead for many years\. In fact, many decisions I initially came under fire for where quickly celebrated as the individuals shined better than others expected\.

After a decade of using this formula, something changed… the hires were still good, but not ‘great’\. The formula had worked brilliantly for me, why was it letting me down now? Or was it me?

I re\-analysed those hires and realised something\. I had changed my view of the components, or more precisely, my interpretation and analysis of them\.

At one point, I had undertaken a role as a recruitment consultant and we were taught to do things in a certain way — namely, look for a pattern of having done it before\. If they were applying to be a project manager, had been a project manager before and undertaken the same types of projects — they had the capability for the advertised role\. Essentially, we were not looking for the best person, but for a past history as the best predictor for a candidate match\.

At some level, I had carried this perception through and I was doing two things wrong, no longer seeking proof they had the knowledge and skills to do the job, but rather, the proof that the job had previously been done\.

Secondly, and possibly more importantly — the definition of capability I was using was completely wrong\.

What else was I misinterpreting? It was time to re\-assess\.
### The Problem with Modern Recruitment

**_Efficiency\._**

Yes, in this case, it is a dirty word\.

Even in the 90s when I was last working as a recruiter, the drive towards spending less than 30 seconds on an application was being driven home in its name\.

Efficiency, in this case, was measured by the speed of sending a candidate for final selection to the client\. It was the highest priority, and we were directed to not waste our valuable time by working on ‘unnecessary and ineffective’ administrative tasks — like hunting passive candidates or thoroughly reviewing the resumes of all applicants\. Instead, we were told to rely on the applicant tracking system \(ATS\) and do a quick scan before a meet and greet\.

Ignoring the fact that most ATS are glorified keyword aggregators, the unintended consequence of this main effort to improve the speed of hiring, has been to shovel more candidates into an applicant funnel\. Ironically, this creates a greater reliance on the ATS by trying to sort through the 200 to 2000 incoming applications for a role\.


> _If the goal is to get better hires in a cost\-effective manner, surely it’s more important to scare away candidates who don’t fit than it is to shovel more candidates into the recruiting funnel?_ 





However, creating an administrative nightmare where applicants are expected to replicate the details in their resume and cover letters to apply is not the answer\.

In a previous role, the HR department implemented a directive that all hires \(including referral and internal candidates\) were placed through the recently implemented ‘top quadrant’ ATS\. We were in the market for some high calibre Enterprise Architects, thus I dutifully used the system and process — and three months later, still had not met a single competent candidate\.

As an exercise, the HR Business Unit Manager and I created a role for my own position and fed through the resumes of 10 of our existing management and director staff\.


> _Apparently, none of them \(including my director nor myself\) would have been selected as the ATS scored us all as unsuitable for the role with a 52% match or lower\._ 





Relying on the ATS created two concerns for me as a hiring manager: the candidates that came through were those that worked out how to game the system by focussing on keyword matching across their resumes, and enforced laziness upon recruiters by only allowing them five seconds to scan the top ten matches — which often led to receiving candidates with a high match of previous job\-titles\.

It is fair to say, I am not an active member of the ATS fan club and seek alternative forms of applicant selection and assessments — organisational policy willing, of course\.
### Ability, Capacity, Capability, Performance: Four of a Kind?

Those words are often used as synonyms when applied to the problem of identifying strengths\. But are there important differences between the four constructs?

I mentioned earlier — I realised I was no longer assessing capability, but measuring previous performance — or put another way, known ability against past capacity\.

To get on the same page, let’s re\-evaluate the words we use\.
- Ability refers to knowledge, skill or proficiency
- Capacity refers to what a person can do with that ability
- Performance refers to what a person actually did in the context of their environment\.
- Capability refers to what a person could do with the opportunity for them to develop or improve\. Their Potential\.


As an example, let’s look at Quinn:
- Quinn has the ability to run
- Quinn has the capacity to run a 100m race in 18 seconds
- Quinn’s performance in their last race was 19 seconds, due to the high heat and winds\.
- Quinn has the capability to improve their capacity through training to race in 15 seconds


As well as understanding abilities, capabilities and capacity it is important for us to also be aware of competence\. The quality or state of being which is functionally adequate to deliver what is required within a context\.
- Quinn has severe social anxiety in large crowds, making them incompetent for large audience races\.


Notice, that Quinn’s competence is contextual\.


> _Performance = context x \(Capacity \+ Ability\)_ 





If my role is to find someone who doesn’t need to compete in large crowds, would they get past my recruiters before I get a chance to evaluate them?
### The Value of Purpose

One day, the Architect of the Cathedral decided to walk amongst the labourers and see how the project was going\. Donning street garb, they were soon amongst the workers when they came upon three masons who were working at chipping chunks of granite from large blocks\.

The first seemed unhappy at their job, chipping away and frequently huffing or looking over to the horizon to spot the setting sun\. When the architect asked what it was the worker was doing, responded, “I’m a mason\. I shape and lay rocks until the sun sets when I can finally go home to my family\.”

The Architect looked at the second mason, seemingly more interested in their work\. The Architect watched as the mason hammered diligently, go and measure a space upon the wall, and return to mould a section before carefully placing it into the assigned space\. The architect asked the same question and the mason replied, “I’m a stone mason and it is my job to practice my art and shape each block of rock so that it can be used with others to construct a wall\. I take pride in my workmanship\.”

The third mason was hammering at their block passionately\. They would stop, step back and admire their work, and then return to chip off small pieces, or smooth out an edge until they seemed satisfied that it was the best they could do\. When questioned about the work the mason stopped, gazed skyward and proudly proclaimed, “I … am building a cathedral\!”

Three people, three different attitudes, all doing the same job\.

Purpose has the power to transform — not only our attitude about the work that we do but the effort and quality with which we do it\.

However, if you had five roles for stonemasons to fill, who would you hire? Would they all be like the third mason? Would you weed out those like the first mason? Would you bring in a mix?

If there are too many like the first mason, they are there to get a job done — and may steer the team to meet the minimum viable effort\. Too many like the third mason and the team is seeking ever\-increasing perfection\.

The answer should depend not only on the culture of your organisation and the makeup of the existing team you have but also the goals\.


> _The why and the what are intrinsically tied\._ 





If the goal is to have a team of adequate, high output labourers, then teams made up of the first type of mason is likely the right answer\. However, if the aim is for grand design and artistic perfection — the third type of mason are probably better candidates\.

The type of mason doesn’t necessarily equate to the satisfaction of the individual\. It’s likely that the first mason is happy with their role — they work to live for their family, have no grand designs on doing anything more\. Never assume an individual is in a rut and not making the effort anymore\.


> _Evaluating the individual’s purpose can provide a clear view of the commitment that an individual will provide\._ 





It can also assist you in understanding the form of development and progression they may seek, at what pace and thus their potential within the context of your organisation\.


> _Commitment = motivation x \(attitude \+ purpose\)_ 





Additionally, without a single interview, I can ascertain which “kind of mason” the candidate is by determining what their resume focuses on\. Am I seeing ten years of experience, or a year of experience repeated ten times? Are their achievements focused on themselves or their employer? Are they focusing on the art of role or the outcome of the achievement?


> _Capability = \(Potential \+ Performance\) / context_ 




### “That’s Great, Taiss, but How does this Help Me\!?”

Like any framework, it’s a scaffold that holds together the bricks and mortar of your choosing\.

The original formula still holds true,


> _For a great hire, evaluate:_ 





> _capability x \(commitment \+ chemistry\)_ 





as long as we are aware of what each element actually is and what to look for\!

Build a plan for what you are seeking and where you will find the evidence for it\. In the image below, I have reminded myself of what I need to determine and where I will source the data for each candidate\.

Initially, I am evaluating their LinkedIn profile and CV — I’m assessing their LinkedIn recommendations, activity, their profile summary, job history and their listed achievements, and how they evaluated their value\.

Before I have even chosen a single candidate, I am already aware of the type of questions I will ask, what that information will give me and why it’s important\.

If my organisation has any specific tests, processes or activities, I’ll also map these out with the relevant importance of data it will provide my assessment\.

If you have lined everything right, you can even have a litmus test of your assessment in a second interview\. I often test my assessments via replaying their responses in the form of scenarios, offering development opportunities and theoretical progression plans\.

Outside of external influences, using this method has gifted me with consistently:
- engaged and enthusiastic teams,
- increased staff retention,
- increased focus on team\-based innovations,
- a higher per\-capita High\-Performance \(HiPo\) rate than peer teams,
- regular external recognition and awards of my staff\.


This has been true whether hiring senior professionals or recent graduates\.

It’s a pattern of success I’m happy to repeat and to share with you\.
