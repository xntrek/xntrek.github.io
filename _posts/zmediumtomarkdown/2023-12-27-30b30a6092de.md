As I pause to reflect on the past year, it strikes me just how transformative these months have been\. It was a year marked not just by change but by a deeper understanding and embracing of diversity, both in thought and in practice\. The journey through the realms of enterprise architecture, inclusivity, and neurodiversity has been nothing short of enlightening\.

The year began with a renewed focus on Enterprise Architecture\. It has been fascinating to witness and participate in EA’s evolution over the years from a discipline primarily focussed on technical strategy to one that embraces a more holistic, strategic and customer\-centric approach\.

This transition has not just been about aligning technology with business strategies but about ensuring that these strategies resonated with the very people they were designed to serve\. I have had the pleasure of delving deeper into the integration of Service Design into EA within my clients\. The insights gleaned were, as expected, eye\-opening — making it clear that when you blend the technical precision of EA with the empathetic approach of Service Design, you unlock a powerful toolkit for organisational transformation\.

As we moved further into the year, I spent more of my focus on a topic that’s close to my heart — inclusivity and neurodiversity in the workplace\.

This led me to explore and advocate for the accommodation of neurodiversity in professional settings\. The conversations and initiatives around spreading awareness, devising strategies, and implementing tools for supporting people with ADHD in the workplace were both challenging and rewarding\. Sharing personal experiences and professional perspectives on these topics brought to light the importance of understanding and embracing the unique contributions of neurodiverse individuals\.

Universal Design principles are a key focus for me and are taking center stage in discussion in this space, underscoring the need to create work environments that are intuitively accessible and welcoming to everyone, irrespective of their abilities or neurocognitive styles\.

The year also saw significant strides in advocating for gender equality and empowerment\. Reflecting on the historical progress and contemporary challenges in this arena was particularly poignant during International Women’s Day\. The evolution from a day of protest for equal pay to a globally recognized event advocating for comprehensive gender equality spoke volumes about the journey still ahead\. It was a reminder of the relentless efforts and unwavering commitment required to bring about true equality and empowerment\.

As I navigated through these diverse yet interconnected realms, I also kept a close eye on the evolving landscape of the Australian consulting industry\. The state of the industry, marked by rapid transformations and a cautious yet optimistic outlook, prompted a deeper examination of current trends and future prospects\. This was complemented by a focus on future\-proofing through diverse talent acquisition, underscoring the critical need to attract a variety of experiences and perspectives to the consulting sector\.

Personal highlights of the year included launching the Neurodiversity Employee Resource Group, an initiative that not only brought immense satisfaction but also reinforced my belief in the power of community and shared experiences\. The engagement and feedback from the community, coupled with insights from various posts and articles, enriched my understanding and appreciation of the collective journey we are all on\.

As I look back on the year, I am filled with gratitude for the growth, learning, and connections made along the way\. It was a year of embracing change, championing inclusivity, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible\.

As we step into the future, I invite you to join me in this ongoing dialogue, sharing your thoughts, experiences, and visions for what lies ahead\. Together, let’s continue to reshape our world, one insight, one action, and one interaction at a time\.
