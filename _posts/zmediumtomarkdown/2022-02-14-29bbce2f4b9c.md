### Organisational Change — I Can Feel it in My Waters

A fish is swimming along one day when another fish comes up and says “Hey, the water’s cold today isn’t it?” The first fish stares back blankly at the second fish and then says, “What’s water?”
### Does Water have Motion and Emotion?

Every system in the human body counts on water to function, and the brain is no exception\. In fact, about 75 percent of brain tissue is water\. Research has linked dehydration to depression and anxiety because mental health is driven primarily by your brain’s activity\.

Water has been shown to have natural calming properties, likely because of addressing dehydration’s effects on the body and brain\.

Drinking enough water is an important step in managing your anxiety\. Even if you’re not experiencing anxiety, drinking sufficient water can create feelings of relaxation\.

Why people are so adversely affected by mild dehydration is unclear, and more research is necessary\. But other research has shown that neurons in the brain detect dehydration and may signal other parts of the brain regulating mood when dehydration occurs\.

This process could be part of an ancient warning system protecting humans from more dire consequences and alerting them to the need for water to survive\.
### Business Change needs Consistent Flow too

As foundations consider the external dynamics of systems change, they must also recognise that this same water of systems change flows within their organisations as well\. Any organisation’s ability to create change externally is constrained by its own internal policies, practices, and resources, its relationships and power imbalances, and the tacit assumptions of its board and staff\.

For example, foundations often distort the dynamics of social change by imposing arbitrary time horizons shaped by their governance processes rather than by any genuine understanding of the systems they seek to change\.

In addition, leaders cannot support efforts that run counter to their own mental models\. The implications of this are daunting\.


> _To fully embrace systems, change, leaders must be prepared to see how their own ways of thinking and acting must change as well\._ 





Paraphrasing Gandhi, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world\.”
### Attaining Vision

Attempting to foster systems change without building the capacity to “see” systems leads to a lot of talk and very little results\. One does not learn to play the violin in a three\-day intensive course\.

Real learning — developing a capability to do something we could not do before — demands deep commitment, mentoring, and never\-ending practice\. The same is true for capacity building among collective actors such as performing arts ensembles or high\-performing sports teams\. This is no different when it comes to fostering systems change\.

As the notion of systems change continues to ignite imagination, it is important to keep in mind that systems change, as a way of making real and equitable progress on critical problems, requires exceptional attention to the detailed and often mundane work of noticing and acting on much that is implicit and invisible to many but is very much in the water\.

Making big bets to tackle a problem without first immersing yourself in understanding what is holding the problem in place is a recipe for failure\. On the other hand, bringing attention to shifting the power dynamics at play, identifying where people are connected or disconnected from others who must be part of the solution, exposing the mental models that inhibit success in policy change, and investigating the ways in which the organisations internal conditions help or hinder external aspirations — this is the nature of successfully changing systems\. This is systems change\.

A commonly used term in business scenarios is that of ‘best practice’\. It’s a term that is meant to indicate the epitome of method — a vaunted higher plane of application that is both suitable and desirable for one and all\.

However, what has worked well in one organisation may well be irrelevant in another\.


> _What helped get useful insight into one innovation problem might be counter\-productive in another\._ 





While it is possible for best practice to work, it does so only when the situation is stable and the “known knowns” are all aligned — the constraints, the structures, procedures, and practices — the relationship between cause and effect is clear, and fixed\. For me, the term conjures up images of a race toward uniform mediocrity, led by those who follow the crowd and it expresses a harmful perspective on things\.

Yet, there’s still a tendency, in any change initiative, to imagine that your organisation is fixed, your environment is fixed, and all you’re doing is moving your organisation from A to B — shifting the furniture, basically\.

This overlooks the reality that \(a\) every organisation operates in \(and is affected by\) multiple external environments simultaneously, and \(b\) the organisation itself is changing every day, whether its members know it or like it\.

A better way to approach change management might be to envision your environment as a wild river, the kind you go white\-water rafting on fast, unpredictable, dangerous in parts, requiring constant course corrections\. Your job is to navigate that river by guiding your craft along with it as best you can — while understanding that the shape of your craft, the people handling the paddles, and your overall water\-worthiness are constantly in flux, often in ways that are beyond your control\.
### Leading Change


> _Anyone can be a leader, but the most effective leaders are authentic\._ 





Authentic leadership only exists in a community, that’s where real authentic leaders emerge\. Authentic leadership isn’t about celebrating oneself; it’s about taking responsibility for everyone and everything around you, including all your flaws and mistakes and failures and successes \(and if you’re not failing or screwing up every now and again, then perhaps there’s something wrong with your ego\) \.

“If you cannot do great things yourself, don’t attempt to do small things in the guise of greatness\.”

— Robert Herjavec

Authentic leaders find joy within their work itself \(who doesn’t like coming home from work satisfied with a job well done?\) \. This is where authentic leaders can find joy\.

They find great pleasure in their work, but they also find this same level of satisfaction when things are not going so well\. Authentic leaders are servant leaders\. They are about the collective good and are selfless\. But they are also introspective and real\.

They acknowledge their mistakes and flaws to themselves and everyone else around them because authentic leaders have no reason to hide or be ashamed of who they truly are\. They’re authentic\.

Leading change is never easy\. It involves standing up and fighting for beliefs and values that might not be shared by everyone in the organisation, and it often means saying no to people who may have been loyal supporters\.


> _Authentic leaders can say no when necessary because authentic leaders do what they believe is right, even if the choice is unpopular or painful\._ 





Authentic leaders don’t try to appear perfect; they try to lead perfectly with an unwavering adherence to their principles and standards of excellence\. They know that other people are watching them carefully, so authentic leaders are careful about how they always behave since other followers look to authentic leaders as role models\.
### Mentoring For Change

Being a mentor is one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done\. It’s incredible to see someone grow in their career, especially when it was something that they weren’t sure would work out for them at first and then suddenly becomes successful\!

I hope my mentorship can help other people find success too — and not just financial gain but also fulfilment from making an impact on others’ lives through what we do here every day\.

Business mentoring is clearly one of the ways that an organisation can strengthen and replicate its culture\. Traditional mentoring favours the “Godfather” approach: the wise, older mentor bestows knowledge on the younger, inexperienced mentee\.

However, these types of mentoring models follow a command\-and\-control style of leadership, and ultimately favour the status quo when it comes to organisational culture\. Business mentors tend to “mentor in their own image,” meaning that they see themselves in their mentees and seek to develop them into a new version of themselves\.

What about organisations that want to change their culture?

First and foremost, mentoring must be personal and not bureaucratic\. If the program comes across as another obligatory HR program, mentees and mentors are likely to resent it or merely go through the motions\.

By bringing together people and parts of the business that might not otherwise interact, mentor programs can help to create informal networks across departments, transfer knowledge, expedite work and create cross\-selling opportunities, all of which lead to better business outcomes\.


> _It’s also critical for employee retention, with Australian millennials rating a positive work environment and learning opportunities as more important than financial benefits\._ 





Working across disciplines also breeds innovation that’s buoyed by strong and well\-thought\-out ideas\. New perspectives encourage creative thinking and open communication channels throughout the business\.

This will be especially important for the new wave of Gen Z employees entering the workforce, with a recent Accenture analysis finding that upon entering the workforce, a whopping 78 percent of Gen Z grads already will have completed an internship, traineeship or work experience — showing an appreciation for the need to bring practical skills to the table from Day One as they embark on their careers\.

But, Gen Z workers expect equal flexibility from their employer to help them maintain work\-life balance — one of their top concerns — as well as expecting training and mentoring\.

To me, this highlights a need for a lot more support and mentorship, particularly for competencies \(softer skills and professional attributes\), rather than technical knowledge\.

It’s an attitude shared by Accenture where we have formalised the process of assigning incoming employees coaches to help leverage their strengths, guide career paths and provide a personal touchpoint beyond their team lead\.

It’s not a new tale that an employee that feels supported is also more likely to continue with your business — thus reducing the volume of staff turnover and encouraging a passion for your company and its culture\.
### Rivers as the Final Water Metaphor

Rivers adapt to changing environments, starting out as streams and rivulets they grow, merge focussing on an ultimate destination\. They adapt their form and shape according to the current climate and external factors encountered as they move towards their goal\.

As the landscape and environmental changes, rivers evolve and move along with it — performing the functions relevant to the current situation, an embodiment of learning organisations\. A river grows, evolves, and changes shape according to the landscape and environment within defined but malleable boundaries\.

They can be redirected, harnessed, channelled, reused, however, a river continues to be a moving body of water that is changing, developing, and growing — and remains fresh\. This is the same approach that modern organisations need to integrate into their culture to adapt and survive in a changing world\.

There is evidence to support the view that organisations that create a state of change readiness to support the transition of the organisation from one state to another are essential to ensure success\.

However, if the organisation is already a river, flexible, adaptable, and responding to the changes to the environment and landscape it could be argued that a state of change readiness already exists\.

If organisations can adapt to the prevailing conditions encountered, and the importance of this can be effectively communicated to employees, organisations can remain fresh — just like clear running water\.
