### RBG, Equality and Gender Neutrality\.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg \(aka ‘RBG’\) espoused a view of equality where women and men have equal access to opportunity, often quoting Sarah Grimke:


> “I ask no favor for my sex\. All I ask of our brethren is that they will take their feet off our necks”\. 





RBG achieved so much during a time when women were not welcome in the law\.

When Ruth Ginsburg studied law at Harvard, she was one of nine women in a class of about 500\. These women had to prove themselves above and beyond the men in the class, justifying to the Dean why they had taken a place that could have gone to a man\.

RBG battled the obstacles in front of her – first as an academic, then to go on and achieve in every profession she worked in\. And she worked in the full gamut of the legal profession in her lengthy career, she was a law researcher, a law professor, a lawyer and a judge\.

As a researcher, she co\-authored the first book in English on Swedish civil law\. As a professor at Rutgers University, she created a course on gender equality and the law and co\-authored the first textbook on this topic\. As a professor, she also fought for equal pay for female academics at her university, who were few and far between in the 1970s – especially at law schools\. The university noted that men had families to support\. So, Ginsburg pointed out, did she\.

With a lifetime of achievements, we can truly remember RBG as “ _someone who used whatever talent she had to do her work to the very best of her ability\. And to help repair tears in her society, to make things a little better through the use of whatever ability she has\._ ”

As a lawyer, she established the American Civil Liberties Union \(ACLU\) Women’s Rights Project \(WRP\) \. She wrote the brief and won the case, that the Fourteenth Amendment prevented differential treatment between men and women\.

She went on to write briefs and/or make arguments in 34 cases for the ACLU WRP\. Out of the six cases she argued before the Supreme Court, she won five\.

An important part of RBG’s arguments about discrimination was that it is a scourge on both genders and that equality benefits both women and men\.

Ginsburg was not solely focused on winning rights for women, but on establishing equal rights for both genders\.

Notably, she represented Charles Moritz, a man who was caring for his elderly mother but had been denied a caregiving tax deduction because he was an unmarried man\. By demonstrating that sex discrimination hurts men as well, she won the case and paved the way for many more to follow\.

So yes, Ginsburg is known for her unwavering support of women’s rights but she also firmly believed that men too should be given equal opportunity in their role as caregivers\.

### **RBG and the Alphabet Mafia**

Let’s be clear\. There is no indication that Ruth Bader Ginsburg intended to blaze a trail for the LGBTQIAP\+ community\.

In her career, she distinguished herself from other lawyers with her original legal arguments and strategies, on behalf of both men and women, opposing discrimination on the basis of sex\. Whereas other women lawyers preceding her unsuccessfully tried to secure equal rights for women by means of the Fourteenth Amendment\.

RBG credited her friend Pauli Murray, the Black lesbian scholar, lawyer, and activist, as the inspiration for the first successful argument applying the Fourteenth Amendment to win equal rights for women\. Ginsburg was victorious in Reed v\. Reed \(1971\), and the Court ruled that administrators for an estate cannot be named so that it discriminates against the sexes, paving the way to expand the Equal Protection Clause to include the LGBTQ community\.

This was also the first time the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was applied to strike down discrimination against women – thus broadening its application beyond its original intent: to protect former Black slaves and their descendants, guaranteeing them equal protection under the law\.

From there it was a string of wins – from Colorado’s anti\-gay Amendment 2, Texas’ laws criminalizing sodomy, that the California state constitution required the term “marriage” to include same\-sex couples, invalidating Proposition 22, then restoring same\-sex marriage rights in California, proving that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, to striking down state bans on marriage for LGBTQ couples and extending full marriage equality\.

RBG was quoted as stating that when same\-sex marriage becomes the law of the land, “ _all of the incentives, all of the benefits that marriage affords would still be available\. So you’re not taking away anything from heterosexual couples\. They would have the very same incentive to marry, all the benefits that come with marriage that they do now\._ ”

In her continuing mission to blaze a trail for equality, RBG never veered from a fight against injustice\. It didn’t matter who was being discriminated against, the fight for justice always came first\.

We are all aware that silence normalises oppression and bias, and so we should all be individuals devoted to the power of equity and resolve not to be silent in light of any form of prejudice, marginalisation, racism or sexism\.
### A Modernised RBG Perspective for Gender Advocacy

Framing RBG’s legacy as being a hero to women is a disservice to her life’s work\.

Men can and should celebrate her work – and not just out of care and respect for the women in their lives, but because she fought for a more equitable society for everyone\.

By removing the stigma, her work allowed society and companies to have an opportunity to promote more equality in caregiving and thus support all employees to grow personally and professionally\. Reflecting on her personal partnership with her husband Martin Ginsberg, RBG shared:


> “If you have a caring life partner, you help the other person when that person needs it\. I had a life partner who thought my work was as important as his, and I think that made all the difference for me\.” \(The Washington Post, 2014\) 





As RBG knew and proved early on in her career, when we provide men and women equal opportunity to be caregivers, we also provide more equal footing in the workplace and improve women’s rights\. So honouring that one part of her life and her work requires our shifting our mindsets and providing pathways for everyone to be caretakers too\.

As a Supreme Court Justice, RBG advanced the Supreme Court’s understanding of gender equality by declaring that a policy is unconstitutional when it “ _denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature – equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities\._ ”

Though RBG’s victories can be attributed largely to her refusal to deviate from the idea of equality as both a legal and political strategy, she has said that she didn’t go to law school with a passion for women’s rights\. She is not just a hero to women and girls or a role model for their daughters; she has also inspired generations of men and boys and fought to make their lives better\.

All of these foundational strides forward for gender equality all happened before the first Millennial was born\.

Yet it is with the Millenial and Gen Z perspective that I would argue we should reframe the RBG message\.

Millennials have recognised the strength of RBG’s vision when they made her “notorious\.” They owe the opportunities they’ve gained to the legal framework she helped reshape and design\.

Now, as we see societal backlashes from political extremists is the time for all of us – be we boomers, Gen X, Millennials or Gen Z – to take up RBG’s legacy into a concrete tool for progress\. By giving renewed voice to that vision of equality, we will not only celebrate Ginsburg but also join her in continuing her work beyond the binary\.

To achieve a more equitable society for everyone, we need to remove gender from the equation\. _There needs to be equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on the individual talents and capacities of the individual and that all of the incentives, all of the benefits that are afforded to any one individual of any gender is afforded to another individual of any other gender identification\._
