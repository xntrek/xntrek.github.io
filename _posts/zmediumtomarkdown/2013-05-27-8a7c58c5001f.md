## Complexity 
#### it’s not a dirty word\.

I have a statement I make often:


> The iceberg principle of complexity:
 

> The simpler it seems, the greater the hidden complexity\. 




It is a statement I make to clients when proposing enterprise solutions\. It is the truth behind corporate statements; political policies; the catalysts for social change … and the list goes on\. From climate change to zero tolerance, the sound bite is always the tip of a very large iceberg\.

Whilst science and technology are the obvious candidates for demonstrating this principle, it is true of almost all aspects of twenty\-first century life\.

However, no truer is this statement than in the reporting of information and facts\.

Journalists, politicians and corporate executives always repeat the same mantra \- that providing broad brush\-strokes and shallow commentary is necessary, especially in an age of information overload\. Keep it simple\. Aim to the lowest denominator\. Brevity is key\.

Yet this practice seems incongruous to me \- because in the reporting of information, brevity is the enemy\.


> The soul of wit may become the very body of untruth\. However elegant and memorable, brevity can never, in the nature of things, do justice to all the facts of a complex situation\. On such a theme one can be brief only by omission and simplification\. Omission and sim­plification help us to understand — but help us, in many cases, to understand the wrong thing; for our compre­hension may be only of the abbreviator’s neatly formu­lated notions, not of the vast, ramifying reality from which these notions have been so arbitrarily abstracted\.

Brevity provides absolutely nothing to build knowledge, nor understanding, and it often does more harm than good through miscommunication of the issues \(at best\) to outright misinformation, misdirection or even outright bias at worst\.

It is one of the reasons that there is the _News is bad for your health\._ Well, at least that is one assertion that Rolf Dobelli, author of “ _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ ” puts forward in an essay available from his website entitled “ [Avoid News](http://www.dobelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Avoid_News_Part1_TEXT.pdf){:target="_blank"} ” that I explore in another article [Removing the blinkers](../3e8e8c54555e/) \.

Yes, we do live in an age of information overload\. However, this does not mean we live in an age of uneducated or rebellion ready masses\. Information does not need to be “filtered”, “diluted” or in any other way “dumbed down” for the masses\.

It’s time to clang the bells and turn the boat around \- give us all the information \- because simplicity is a false economy and complexity is not a dirty word\.


> But life is short and information endless: nobody has time for everything\. In practice we are generally forced to choose between an unduly brief exposition and no exposition at all\. Abbreviation is a necessary evil and the abbreviator’s business is to make the best of a job which, though intrinsically bad, is still better than nothing\. He must learn to simplify, but not to the point of falsification\. He must learn to concentrate upon the essentials of a situation, but without ignor­ing too many of reality’s qualifying side issues\. In this way he may be able to tell, not indeed the whole truth \(for the whole truth about almost any important sub­ject is incompatible with brevity\), but considerably more than the dangerous quarter\-truths and half\-truths which have always been the current coin of thought\.
