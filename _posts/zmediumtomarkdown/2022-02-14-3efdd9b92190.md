### The Generalist: A Specialist Capability


![](/assets/3efdd9b92190/0*FcdsABzRwwzdU4aT)


I am often amused by those who deride my career and knowledge with a dismissive wave of a hand, “oh, a generalist? So you don’t have a speciality?”

As a generalist, what I do have are a very particular set of skills\. Skills I have acquired over a very long career\. Skills that make me a nightmare for people who are too focused on a single niche\.

My career trajectory has been unplanned and erratic\. I have often described it as a lightning fork path that was best explained with two phrases — “huh, that sounds interesting\!” and “impossible challenge you say? Accepted\!”

In a world of niche skills and job titles — I often have difficulty describing the entirety of the [accumulation of my polymathic skill](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/vocational-shapes-rhizomes-taiss-quartapa-gaicd/?=){:target="_blank"} set and the capability offered in engaging me\. I can just as easily describe myself as a Business Architect as I could a Board Advisor, Change Agent or Learning Facilitator\. Am I just one of these? No, I am all of them, and more — also a little less\.
### Enterprise Service & Business Design

As a generalist, I have found the work of a Business Designer is the perfect mix of systems thinking, design mindset, methodologies, tools and experiential knowledge to solve complex problems often found in the organisational challenges of the modern era\.

The work allows for an end\-to\-end view with the ability to deep dive into the surface\-to\-core elements of people, tools and processes that are crucial to the success of any organisational change\.

Many in this space tend to come with mixed backgrounds — often from ‘traditional’ enterprise roles \(Organisational Change, Business Process Modelling, Business / Enterprise Architecture, etc\) where they have integrated other disciplines or knowledge\.

They share common attributes which include a mix of enterprise design, process mapping and re\-engineering expertise hand in hand with HC/DT to map and transformational guidance required for an improved seamless experience for both front\-end and back\-end stakeholders\. They have the ability to takes a holistic view of organisational change with a particular focus on Business Centric Challenges\.
### A Snapshot of my toolshed\.

The following image is a non\-exhaustive view of just a part of my working world\.

The tools and methods highlighted here are not necessarily unique to this role\. Service Designers, Management Consultants and Business Architects will recognise many of these\.

This is only a map that demonstrates just some of the many ways these tools and outputs can influence each other in the pursuit of building a better organisation or service design — and just as importantly — implementation\.

Depending on the nature of the engagement, and the outcomes sought, will dictate the choice of tools, and the pattern of usage of those tools\.


![](/assets/3efdd9b92190/0*pY_LNstBRl2lOrCH)


For example, in looking at the culture alignment of an organisation, one would consider utilising a number of tools — A culture alignment canvas would utilise the inputs from the BMM and values of the organisation, from which the answers to the questions when considering my role in line with the business Mission \(“am I working on the right thing?”\), Vision \(“am I heading in the right direction?”\) and Values \(“am I doing it the right way?”\) are reflected clearly in the cultural to employee profile mapping\.

The combination of these elements should then be reflected in a set of balanced and aligned Objectives and Key Results \(OKR\) that are balanced against the needs of the organisation, the department and the individual\.

In the arena of assessing the technology landscape, the engagement may delve further into the alignment and guidance of the Enterprise Architecture before assessing the Delivery Architecture and specifically consider the use of Ecosystem and Wardley mapping techniques\.

In considering a transformation programme, the process might incorporate a number of inputs — which may make use of system thinking tools \(for example — business model canvas, capability maps, porters five forces and STEEPLE analysis, etc\) as well as the input and guidance of HC/DT outputs \(such as value stream maps, experience maps and service designs\) to culminate in an Operating Model design as a basis of organisational structuring\.
### More than Tools\.

The focus on tools and methods are part of the systems\-thinking view of the business world\. Socially, we have a strong trust and emphasis on empirical evidence and revel in the wisdom of quotes such as “you can’t manage what you can’t measure\.”

Yet, the reality is we are working on an ecosystem — one made up of humans as well as systems\. This requires a range of skills that are often overlooked or dismissed as “soft\-skills”\. Part of the role is to be a servant\-leader and remembering that “leadership is doing the right things\.”

The skills required to navigate this world incorporate:
### Hybrid\-Thinking

The concept of hybrid thinking isn’t new\. As it is an organic discipline, expounding the definition of the term is varied\. In this sense, I am simplifying the concept to simply mean the ability to traverse and engage with the multi\-disciplinary processes using a mix of systems and design thinking\.

While it may be fun and obfuscating to use smart\-sounding sentences such as “utilising co\-creative exploration of human\-centred experiences that are culturally meaningful, technically feasible, and economically sustainable”, the reality is that the individual needs to be able to use the right tool — and associated thinking style — at different times\. As an example, the previous toolshed image could be split into some basic generic groupings, as demonstrated in the following image\.

Fundamentally, the purpose of Systems Thinking is to solve problems and create desirable futures\. The goal of creative or design thinking is to connect the dots for generating naval ideas\. In utilising these methods together, a hybrid thinking designer is seeking to:
- connect the dots within complex systems;
- think inclusively and holistically;
- determine and comprehend dynamics;
- understand expensive variables, interfaces, and interactions; and
- utilise various modes of induction, deduction, and exaptation techniques\.


The ability allows the designer to traverse the knowledge funnel:

to simultaneously engage within each layer, as well as facilitating the multi\-disciplinary processes required to tackle and iteratively implement transformative, innovative, and strategic changes\.
### Adaptability

Whilst speaking of the ability to flip thinking styles, let’s also recognise the ability to orchestrate an overall \(set 0f\) framework\(s\) within which effective services operate, but the reality is that within those frameworks, much can shift and evolve\. The ability to not only handle but engage with ambiguity and change is a large part of the role function\.

You need to be prepared, as I have often stated, for random and exotic changes\. The ability to only retain an overall skeletal approach, ready to bend, alter or completely rework any aspect in response to deeper exploration, clarification and understanding of the organisation, its processes and its people is crucial to the success of the role\. Your role is to adapt the approach, the facilitation and even the methodologies as required to be successful\.

Ultimately, this is as much an attitude as it is a skill\. Empathy, interest and a desire to reach the agreed outcome will be factors in your ability to anticipate and respond to the issues that may prevent the impact the client is aspiring to\.
### Outcomes\-Focus

Determining the impact we are striving for as a result of the design is critical\. With any form of strategic design, ultimately, the work will naturally drive toward measurable outcomes for the recipients and, ideally, all stakeholders\. The primary aim should be a focus on outcomes for the recipients\.

Through a facilitated workshop, it is part of the role to create a collaborative determination at the start of the work what it is that the client hopes to accomplish by the end\. These are qualitative measures, not outputs or metrics\. Essentially, we ask four primary questions of our clients to determine this goal:
1. How much do we do? \(the quantity of service\)
2. How well do we do it? \(the quality of the service\)
3. Who is better off and how do we measure if they are better off? \(the impact of the service, or recipient outcome\)
4. What do we propose to do? \(the action plan\)


Once these agreed\-upon success factors are established, we can transparently assess satisfaction with the recipients and the client — translating these into objectives, result metrics and balanced measures\.
### Co\-creation

Any service is a result of a co\-created experience among all of the people involved and only through iterative ideation does an effective service come to fruition\. Often, this is an amalgamated process that can be oversimplified into a network diagramme as below\.

It’s not uncommon for knowledge\-based professionals and gig workers, such as consultants and designers, to be reluctant to share work and methodologies with clients until we feel completely prepared\. However, what we perceive as being comprehensive, is risked as being perceived as un\-collaborative and closed\-off by the very clients we are seeking to serve\.

Throughout a project, exposing the client to your in\-progress thinking, encouraging their participation, their knowledge, their feedback and even assigning them work and deliverables creates a collaborative, skill\-sharing and equal ownership of the programme\. Furthermore, it is a service that is being designed for them and their recipients, so they should be involved in creating the content and witnessed the approach, and the subsequent outcomes, first\-hand\. This is a large part of the co\-creation mind and skill set\.

### Facilitation \(& Coaching\)

In every role I have ever held, one truth has been universal — taking them on the journey delivers greater understanding and satisfaction than the delivery of even the most scrupulously prepared solution\.

Related to the cross\-functional nature of the role, facilitation skills are key to guiding diverse teams and stakeholders through initiatives, processes and workshops\. Rather than being armed for meetings with presentations, printouts and deliverables for clients to react to — I prefer to access whiteboards — bringing markers, post\-it notes and being prepared with activities for them to participate in\.

Being able to take various stakeholders and lead them through a methodology requires you to not only be a subject matter expert, but also a capable “teacher” through facilitation\. When clients partake in and see the tangible outcomes of the design work you are doing with them, they not only begin to understand the potential impact these practices have on transforming their business for them, but it often sparks new ideas, insights and directions that ultimately improve the outcomes sought\.

This is why facilitation skills are crucial\. The ability to step out of the role of “expert” and into the role of “sideline coach” is not natural, nor easy — but worth every effort to achieve\. By giving direction on activities, challenging thinking, providing tools or methods and avenues of development and learning — I am helping the individuals and the organisation towards improved outcomes, collaboration and ultimately, satisfaction\.
### Contextual Sense\-Making

This is a crucial capability\. Sensemaking is the ability \(or at least the attempt\) to make sense of an ambiguous situation\. It is “a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections \(which can be among people, places, and events\) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively”\. It requires the ability to synthesise, futurise and, ultimately, communicate with storytelling\.

The skill requires maintaining situational awareness, creating understanding in situations \(especially in times of uncertainty or complexity\) through taking inputs of all kinds — research findings, analytics, customer feedback, ideation, strategic directives — and form theories, frameworks, and insights — often on the fly — and turn this into a direction to guide service efforts\.

The work of designing for business and service is often the work of designing the future — imagining various versions of a future state, weighing options and strategy, helping teams set sights on “guiding star” to enable and develop services\.

Envisioning future scenarios, and balancing those with business requirements, customer experiences, and other contextual factors is a design superpower\.

No great vision for change will inspire others without strong storytelling skills\. Analogies and storytelling are the best way to make ideas understandable\. It allows us to take the power of emotion and personal connection to make ideas stick\.
### … and a Curiosity Mindset\.

A Business Designer has an understanding of, and stays up to date on trends and changes, across a broad range of industries and business models\.

A great business designer goes beyond to play the role of a dilettante in all areas of innovation — including behavioural, sociological, and design methodologies\. Because innovation is rarely a eureka moment in the mind of a brilliant individual\. In truth, it is often a matter of accumulation and “borrowed brilliance”\. It is a result of clever recombination of existing ideas\.

Therefore, a Business Designer who is very good at asking questions, maintaining an open mind and seeking out to new experiences to constantly try to not only make sense but enhance understanding of the world around them — is more likely to make connections to previous knowledge in pursuit of sustainable, re\-imagined or fresh solutions to the clients' needs\.

Being a generalist is not a surface\-level scraping of topics, but a cornucopia of tools, methods, skills and mindsets that allow me to focus on the outcomes far beyond any specific output or methodology\.

I hope this offers a view into my very specialised world of being a generalist and allows those who may have previously been dismissive of such a descriptor, to find a new appreciation for the lost art of the specialist generalist\.
