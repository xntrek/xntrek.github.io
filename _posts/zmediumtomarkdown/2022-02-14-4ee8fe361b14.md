### “Culture and Bullshit for the new normal”​


![](/assets/4ee8fe361b14/0*2sVkLh5Fr-sjZiXC)


Famous English poet T\.S\. Elliot was known for his witty turn of phrase and versatility, having penned such masterpieces as ‘The Naming of Cats’\.

What is not so well known is his fondness for etymology, the study of the origin of words\. Unusually two words fascinated him — Culture and Bullshit\. I’d like to discuss the origins of both these words and how easily they can be linked together\.

And I thought that Elliot and I only had our love of cats in common\.

Using “bull” to mean a lie or falsehood can be traced back to the Old French word ‘bole’, which means “deception, trick, scheming, intrigue” according to the Oxford English Dictionary\. Bole developed into the Middle English “bull,” meaning “false talk, fraud,” and was used in the 14th century\.

Whilst the popularisation of “bullshit” into slang is credited to the Americans, the word did exist before it reappeared in common usage\. Most notably, it was part of the title of an unpublished T\.S\. Eliot poem called “The Triumph of Bullshit\.

The word “culture” derives from a French term, which in turn derives from the Latin ’colere’, which means “to cultivate, to till or tend \[the earth\], to grow, or nurture”\. It shares its etymology with several other words related to actively fostering growth but also inhabiting and \[place\] to live in\.

For some, it refers to the appreciation of good literature, music, art, and food\. For biologists, it is likely to be a colony of bacteria or other microorganisms growing in a nutrient medium in a laboratory Petri dish\.

However, for anthropologists and other behavioural scientists, culture is the full range of learned human behaviour patterns\. The term was first used in this way by the pioneer English Anthropologist Edward B\. Tylor in his book, Primitive Culture, published in 1871\.

Tylor said that culture is “that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by mankind as a member of society\.”

Not surprisingly, it seems that even from the very beginning when we discuss culture in business, we are talking about the activity of nurturing and fostering growth\. Like all things that grow, nutrients and fertiliser are required — however, unlike mushrooms, it’s very important that in business, our people aren’t fed bullshit\.
### In Business Culture Has Its Breakfast of Champions

Management Guru Peter Drucker is famously credited with stating that ‘culture eats strategy for breakfast’\.


> _So, what does “culture eats strategy” mean for you and your organisation?_ 





In a very practical sense, no matter what business strategy or strategic plan you try to implement with your team, its success and efficacy are going to be held back, not by the people implementing the programme, but by a culture that does not support it\.

It means that if the people driving the strategy have failed to pass on their passion about the change, then you stand no chance of implementing a plan\. A change programme where the message is distilled to just process, commands and directions creates an atmosphere of apathy\.

Not only does apathy affect programme success but it also impairs job execution and the whole organisation\. Which cannot merely undermine the changes intended but create organisational impairments and morale deficiencies in its wake\.

In 2021 and beyond, organisations require an understanding of several threads of wisdom\. The first is an age\-old message that “the purpose of business is to create and keep a customer” accompanied by the renewed message that “people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it\.”

These are a crucial foundation stone of the three biggest organisational zeitgeists as we travel into the 2020’s — the continuation of digital\-enabled strategy, experience design\-led approaches and integrating social\-impact initiatives\.


> _However, every building needs load\-bearing walls, and in the new disrupted business, it is embodied by your organisation’s greatest assets, and your true competitive advantage, your employees\._ 





Your institutional journey demands an understanding that culture is the strategy and is embodied through critical messages, such as “if you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients” and, in the principles of many of the digital era methods, “individuals and interactions over processes and tools\.”
### The Relationship Between Culture and Strategy

Strategy, at its core, is rational and logical, clear and simple\. It should be easy to comprehend and to talk about\. Without a clear strategy, an organisation is lost\.

Corporate culture means different things to different people\. Culture is human, vulnerable, and as moody as the people who define it, accept it and even those who reject it\. Never underestimate the effect emotional contagions have upon your teams\.

Corporate culture is an incredibly powerful factor in a company’s long\-term success\. No matter how good a strategy is, when it comes down to it, people always make the difference\.


> _The beginning of a transformative strategy is thus understanding that the strategy is just the headline of the institution’s story\._ 





Swift, wholesale culture change is not possible or even desirable\. After all, a company’s culture is its basic personality, the essence of how its people interact and work\. It is emotional, ever\-changing, and complex\. Most of all, I’ll reiterate that culture is human\.

When we simplify the concept, culture is fundamentally the self\-sustaining pattern of behaviour that determines how things are done\. The institution needs to care and groom the culture ‘entity’ to help define these patterns of behaviour\.

Because so many companies are run by people whose expertise is heavily skewed to quantification, maintaining the rational, financial, legal and measurable side of the equation — culture is often subordinated, misunderstood, or unappropriated\.

Too often, a company’s strategy, imposed from above, is at odds with the ingrained practices and attitudes of its culture\. Leaders may underestimate how much a strategy’s effectiveness depends on cultural alignment\.
#### The difference between Climate and Weather

Just like the difference between weather and climate is a measure of time — weather being the atmospheric condition at a point in time whilst climate is how the atmosphere “behaves” over relatively long periods of time — so too is the format of the culture you instil in your organisation\.

Organisational culture is comprised of the behaviours, beliefs, habits, and assumptions from which all members of a particular group operate\.

Leadership climate, by contrast, has far less to do with an organisation’s values and far more to do with an individual’s mindset\. Leadership climate can be changeable, but it can also have a significant impact on the mood and productivity — the individual weather patterns — of the teams and individuals\.

Many organisations can become distracted by climate, thinking that they need only lift the mood of the workplace to change its culture\. Is the overall climate cold and damp, or is it sunny and warm?

We all want a warm and sunny climate; however, a healthy organisational culture is about more than just making the workplace environment feel nicer\. It’s about having the clarity and alignment the organisation needs to succeed\.

Most people feel better when the sun is shining; they walk with a smile and are more open to noticing what is around them\. When it is wet and cold most of us place our eyes to the floor and get to where we need to be without noticing much around us\. This metaphor can be reflected by the leaders who are trying to drive organisational culture\.

Do we have emotionally intelligent leaders, creating a warm, open climate where people can grow through curiosity and robust debate? Where decisions and debate can be efficient because there is no threat and so no\-one needs to defend themselves and position for ‘victory’?
### Culture in a Digital Business

Digital business has a different culture and mindset than a traditional business\. Digital Leaders are required to manage the culture and mindset which will incorporate helping set the pace of business, enable distributed decision\-making and set flexible, distributed workplaces — all of which are seen as the most significant differences between digital and traditional businesses\.

Digital institutions push decision\-making further down into the structure\. If an institution wishes to become more innovative, more entrepreneurial, faster\-moving, more collaborative and empowered, then an autonomous, authorised and distributed decision\-making structure is needed to change the way the institution operates\.

The key traits of effective Digital Leadership within these institutions are all about enabling the digital operating model, providing vision and purpose, creating conditions to experiment, empowering people to think differently, and getting people to collaborate across boundaries\.

Just as there is no universal strategy, there is no standard \[digital\] culture\.
### Trust in all Businesses

_I firmly believe that trust is right at the foundation of the survival and success of any business\. Without trust, there can be no sustainable business\._
#### TRUST = Transparency; Responsibility; Understanding; Strategy; Truth\.

Working relationships that have been built on trust are an important sustainable competitive advantage because trust is so valuable and so rare\. The level of trust a leader is able to achieve with their associates is contingent upon the associate’s perceptions of the leader’s ability, honesty and integrity\.
#### Transparency

In the workplace, I often use the phrase, ‘for complete transparency’ because I believe it’s important that my team members have a window into the influences that affect my decisions\. Decision making without bias is impossible and calling out on the filters that sit in the paradigm of my decision making serves me well and allows my colleagues to call me out on them\.
#### Responsibility

To take responsibility you need to be clear that you first have it\. Too often teams get caught up in who is to blame, or at the very least responsible to fix a problem when time in the planning stage of a project has not been allocated to properly defining responsibility\. Everyone should be given the Accountability, Autonomy and Authority to undertake their role\.
#### Understanding

Active and genuine listening is one of the tools a good leader can utilise well in team interaction\. Team members don’t necessarily need to be managed as much as heard\. Their problems fixed as much as understood\. Managers should utilise empathy and generosity to contextually communicate and interact with all stakeholders\.
#### Strategy

It is essential to explain intentions, visions, and long\-term goals so everyone is working towards the same outcome\.
#### Truth

This all comes back to people\. Trust that you have the right team, that they have the integrity to practice your values rather than simply professing them, and they can handle the most important and hardest truths\.
### So, How to Avoid the Bullshit?

Unlike agriculture, bullshit is not the key foundation of cultivating healthy growth and like its namesake, should rest among the theories scattered on the grass\.

Digital leaders understand that there is a fundamental difference between saying “we need an intelligent sensor connected app” and “we need a new way to effectively serve customers — in a way, time and place they want”\.


> _The key traits of effective Leadership in the coming decade are all about enabling the digital operating model, through a focus on the human, and the culture it inhabits\._ 





A growth mindset is key to digital transformation, and it is simply the fundamental belief that a human being’s potential is unknowable\. Which means Talent \(be it intelligence, skill, capability and even personality traits\) can be developed and improved\.

Thus, developing, not just hiring, digital leaders is what sets these maturing companies apart from their competitors\.

It starts with providing vision and purpose\. It gathers momentum through empowering people to think differently, to collaborate across boundaries and create conditions to listen and experiment\.

Consider it much like implementing an organised religion versus a spiritual philosophy\. In organised religion, the structure, forms, practices — every little aspect of the implementation — must be identical no matter where it places itself\. Yet a spiritual philosophy is more focussed on the principles and behaviours over the uniformity of practice\.

Allowing for a principles\-based approach makes space for sub\-cultures to be defined — weather patterns, as it were — that best suit the situation, whilst still contributing to the overall climate\.

This provides the environment to actively cultivate and foster growth, a place that people live in, that is tended and nurturing\.

A living culture is what you need to drive an institution forward\. That attitude is the one thing organisations can no longer allot as an “intangible” element in the background, lest it indeed festers and grows nothing but mushrooms\.

What are you cultivating and growing in your team and organisation with your culture?
